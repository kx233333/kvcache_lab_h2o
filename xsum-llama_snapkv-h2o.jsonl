The firm admitted a Health and Safety Executive (HSE) breach and was fined \u00c2\u00a37,500. It must also pay \u00c2\u00a31,120 costs. The hearing heard how the worker had to have the big toe on his left foot amputated and two other toes removed. He was in hospital for seven days but has since returned to work, the hearing heard.

Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: Head coach Stuart Lancaster's World Cup preparations suffered a blow as for the first 70 minutes a largely first-choice XV struggled to deal with French power. Two late tries flattered the visitors, who have one game left before launching their World Cup campaign against Fiji on 18 September. \"We gave away penalties and our discipline was shocking,\" said Robshaw. \"Whether it was rust, or nerves, it wasn't good enough. Credit to France, they put us under pressure and made us make mistakes. \"We gave too many penalties away, but in the second half we came out and played well but couldn't quite get over the line in the end,\" he told Sky Sports. \"We can't give teams like France and other quality sides head starts like we did. \"We'll look long and hard at ourselves, because we let ourselves down in the first half. We played well in phases but you can't wait for 40 minutes to do that.\" Late tries from Danny Cipriani and Jonathan Joseph made it close on the scoreboard but Lancaster was left with much to ponder by a disappointing team display in the Stade de France. Media playback is not supported on this device The head coach, who must announce his final squad by 31 August, added: \"We've got to get our discipline at the breakdown - we can't give France easy position like we did. We need to improve on that, because all the little mistakes add up. \"The bench made a difference. It upped the energy levels and we scored some good tries. I won't gloss over what went on before that, because it was too little too late. \"There are a few players who have given me food for thought, those guys who came on and gave us the energy we needed and made a difference. \"I need to have a sleep on this game and think about my final squad. We're two weeks away from playing Ireland and four weeks away from Fiji in the World Cup and we'll expect a reaction next time.\" England host Ireland in their final World Cup warm-up game at Twickenham on 5 September. Fly-half Ford told Sky Sports: \"I thought we might snatch that at the end but we had hardly any ball in the first half and gave away too many penalties. We played some good stuff in the second-half. \"In the first half a lot of our undoing was down to ourselves. We just weren't good enough in that first half and there's no excuse for that. We let them build up the score and that made it hard for us. \"It was frustrating and we had to think of ways to adapt and that was constantly going through our minds.

The five-time major winner told BBC Sport: \"If I look back to my mid-30s, I am 35lbs lighter, in better shape than I was and can manage the symptoms of my psoriatic arthritis.

I am optimistic about this week and the coming years and the opportunities to add to my resume.\" Mickelson teed off in overcast but benign conditions and covered the front nine in 33 shots, very nearly acing the eighth hole. It started to rain when he hit the turn and he dropped his first shot of the tournament at the par-four 12th, but ground things out as others wilted. Mickelson's feats were brought into sharper focus by the efforts of playing partners Lee Westwood and Ernie Els, who started their rounds on level par.

After all, Ringrose wears the number 13, played for Blackrock, UCD, Leinster and didn't start his rugby career as a centre. But the 22-year-old new kid on the block appears destined to make a name for himself and his entry into the Six Nations fray is keenly anticipated. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt was careful not to throw Ringrose into the international arena too early. But the emerging player is regarded as a young man with a mature head in his shoulders, someone well equipped to handle hype and huge media attention. But, what makes him so special? What are the qualities that had O'Driscoll himself calling for the Leinster lad to be included in Ireland's last Six Nations campaign? \"He has been anointed the next Brian O'Driscoll. Brian was similar at that age, efficient and solid,\" says Eddie O'Sullivan, Ireland's coach from 2001 to 2008. \"Garry's trademark is he is incredibly efficient. Young players make bloopers, but he doesn't make mistakes. It's important to remain calm under pressure and then when your opportunity comes, you take it. \"Brian didn't make mistakes and then he stepped up. No-one expected him to score a try in Paris in 2000, but he scored three. \"Then no-one expected him to score that try against Australia for the Lions a year later, but he did. These are the moments. They came to him and he took them. Then he kicked on, kept improving.\" Ringrose made his senior Ireland debut in the autumn international against Canada last November, a week after being an unused replacement in that historic win over the All Blacks in Chicago. He then scored his first international try in the exciting 27-24 win over Australia in Dublin. Ringrose played his school rugby for Blackrock College in Dublin, although when he joined the senior side, he wasn't seen as one of their better players. Hopping from number nine to 15 and not being offered a permanent position, he kept his head down and eventually an injury opened up a spot at 13. After the switch, he remained their kicker and his points tally propelled Blackrock to the Leinster Senior Cup. Suddenly people were asking who this guy was and he was off to UCD with a glowing reputation. Bobby Byrne, the Director of Rugby at UCD, recalls: \"I first came across Gary in that run to the Senior Cup. He wasn't overly recognised at that stage but suddenly he was having a significant impact for the team. He is the player I am most looking forward to seeing in this year's Six Nations. \"He had composure, was an elusive runner and was really courageous. He hadn't the biggest frame, but he had a good bit of pace to finish off. \"He had, and still has, a great temperament. He is a very balanced guy. The rate of improvement since he has left school has been phenomenal. \"He has improved every year and he's conscious that he always needs to improve, so his\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nApril 199999999999999. 1999999999999999999.9999999999999999999999", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "A", "pril", "\u2581", "1", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", ".", "\u2581", "1", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", ".", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9", "9"], "token_logprobs": [-0.013465648517012596, -1.1642615795135498, -0.7929155230522156, -0.0018086755881085992, -0.18415524065494537, -0.008735419251024723, -0.16442839801311493, -0.17063775658607483, -0.19723203778266907, -0.22818434238433838, -0.2225147932767868, -0.15263795852661133, -0.08768977224826813, -0.06263160705566406, -0.07296688854694366, -0.0669976994395256, -0.04453461617231369, -0.026244129985570908, -0.031199738383293152, -0.032125189900398254, -0.8760629892349243, -0.6299526691436768, -0.00657727150246501, -0.015140843577682972, -0.016954831779003143, -0.021145498380064964, -0.030266834422945976, -0.04260370135307312, -0.05094967409968376, -0.036381300538778305, -0.04573221504688263, -0.052240435034036636, -0.030953707173466682, -0.018021533265709877, -0.02211819589138031, -0.025910688564181328, -0.016531748697161674, -0.011046210303902626, -0.014208345673978329, -0.018482254818081856, -0.010808495804667473, -0.23488955199718475, -0.00018106251081917435, -0.00046456989366561174, -0.001916716224513948, -0.0072504254058003426, -0.015022245235741138, -0.025958197191357613, -0.017066404223442078, -0.011305673979222775, -0.017635326832532883, -0.024816442281007767, -0.01543575432151556, -0.00804824661463499, -0.011615150608122349, -0.015947062522172928, -0.00491933012381196, -0.0038494786713272333, -0.0054360427893698215, -0.007481769192963839, -0.006122405640780926, -0.003448018804192543, -0.005138049367815256, -0.006722453515976667], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.013465648517012596, "A": -1.1642615795135498, "pril": -0.7929155230522156, "\u2581": -0.8760629892349243, "1": -0.6299526691436768, "9": -0.006722453515976667, ".": -0.010808495804667473}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Sir Patrick presented the first edition of The Sky at Night on 24 April 1957. He became famous for his habit of wearing a monocle on screen, as well as his dishevelled and idiosyncratic persona. However, he was a celebrated and gifted astronomer and wrote dozens of books, with his research being used by the US and the Soviet Union in their space programmes.

The dog, a one-year-old Australian sheepdog named Poppy, went with her. Police confirmed that Poppy's barking alerted rescuers to the whereabouts of the pair after a seven-hour search. Rescuers found Sophia and Poppy 200m from a dam on the family's property. The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted Sophia's grandmother, Vera Cook, who credited the dog with saving the toddler's life. She said that Sophia was wearing just a nappy and T-shirt when she wandered off. \"The only thing I was thinking was well, hopefully the dog would have kept her warm,\" Ms Cook was quoted as saying. \"If [the dog] wasn't with her, I don't know whether they would have found her.\" The family issued a statement thanking emergency services and promising that Poppy would be \"well fed this evening\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA pet dog is being credited with keeping a little girl safe after the pair wandered away from their family home and could not be found for hours.\n\n###\nArticle: The 49-year-old Colorado native, whose legal pedigree includes Harvard and Oxford, would succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia if confirmed. He is favoured by many conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law as Scalia. Judge Gorsuch was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. Judge Gorsuch began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, the latter of whom he could now serve alongside. He worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Perhaps it was during his time in England that he accumulated what his former law partner, Mark Hansen, has said was \"an inexhaustible store\" of Winston Churchill quotes. Judge Gorsuch - who reportedly likes to fly-fish and hunt - lives in Boulder with his wife Louise and two daughters, where he is also an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado. If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the only Protestant on the current bench. The other justices are Jewish and Catholic. His family is well-connected in Republican establishment politics. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was the first female director of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Reagan administration. He is known for his clear and concise writing style, navigating the most complex legal issues as deftly as the double-black diamond slopes on which he is reputedly an expert skier in the snow-capped mountain state he calls home. Judge Gorsuch's published writings reveal his conservative leanings. He argued against euthanasia in his 2006 book The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. \"All human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong,\" he wrote. In a 2005 article in the National Review, Judge Gorsuch argued that \"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom\". He said they keep \"relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda\". Judge Gorsuch has never ruled on abortion, and he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on that issue or gay marriage. His conservative outlook cements Mr Trump's campaign promise to nominate a judge \"in the mould\" of Justice Scalia, restoring the nine-seat high court's 5-4 conservative majority. Much like the late Scalia, the Ivy-League educated judge is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. While sitting on the bench of the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch sided with groups that successfully challenged the Obama administration's requirements for employers to provide health insurance that includes contraception in the Hobby Lobby Stores\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\n\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4", "\u00c4"], "token_logprobs": [-0.00030882356804795563, -0.08438524603843689, -3.0517112463712692e-05, -2.098061486321967e-05, -5.864924969500862e-05, -6.985420623095706e-05, -9.023735765367746e-05, -0.00010191874753218144, -8.666139910928905e-05, -0.000102037942269817, -0.0001137191939051263, -8.809178689261898e-05, -7.414542778860778e-05, -8.618460560683161e-05, -9.059495641849935e-05, -6.460934673668817e-05, -4.053033626405522e-05, -4.95898348162882e-05, -5.4834770708112046e-05, -3.611976353568025e-05, -3.0636318115284666e-05, -3.659658250398934e-05, -3.659658250398934e-05, -2.539125671319198e-05, -2.0503786799963564e-05, -2.276871418871451e-05, -2.396077979938127e-05, -1.2516897186287679e-05, -1.1801649634435307e-05, -1.4543427823809907e-05, -1.5258672647178173e-05, -1.156323378381785e-05, -1.1801649634435307e-05, -1.4185804502631072e-05, -1.5258672647178173e-05, -1.2397689715726301e-05, -8.22540732769994e-06, -9.298280929215252e-06, -9.775113539944869e-06, -6.198863957251888e-06, -5.960446742392378e-06, -7.033323527139146e-06, -7.510157047363464e-06, -6.079655122448457e-06, -4.6491513785440475e-06, -5.364403477869928e-06, -5.960446742392378e-06, -4.768360213347478e-06, -3.6954811548639555e-06, -4.529942543740617e-06, -5.245195097813848e-06, -3.4570634852570947e-06, -2.0265558760002023e-06, -2.622600959512056e-06, -3.2186455882765586e-06, -2.50339189733495e-06, -1.4305104514278355e-06, -1.9073468138230965e-06, -2.264974000354414e-06, -1.4305104514278355e-06, -9.536738616588991e-07, -1.4305104514278355e-06, -1.7881377516459906e-06, -1.0728830375228426e-06], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.00030882356804795563, "\u00c4": -1.0728830375228426e-06}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

By the end of the 80s, the graffiti culture was being forced to adapt, as by then, New York's Transit Authority had brought in procedures that made it tougher to gain access to the train yards. New models with coatings that were resistant to paint, and faster cleaning of any that were covered in graffiti also meant the artists' work was short-lived and the thrill of seeing the work trundling around the city was lost. In the years since, some of the artists have fared well in the US and Europe, others have spent time in prison, one has become a policeman and some have died. The art itself is now part of the mainstream, no longer reserved for city walls but a regular part of a designer's armoury. For Cooper, the graffiti work is an important part of her time in New York, producing the images she is most proud of, rather than those shot on assignment for newspapers or magazines. At times, she would spend hours waiting and watching, for that moment when good light combined with a powerful piece of art passing through an interesting part of the city. Chalfant approached the graffiti from a different angle, concentrating on the work itself, often shooting a series of overlapping images using the motor drive on his camera. He would then splice the pictures together in his studio. He said at the time: \"I was more interested in capturing the beautiful, ephemeral work of art than in taking a beautiful picture as a photographer.\" Here is a selection of the photographs by Cooper and Chalfant.

In February, a consignment of beef being stored at Freeza Meats was found to contain horsemeat. It did not belong to Freeza Meats and none of their products tested positive for horsemeat. Mr Fairburn, who is now retired, said the beef belonged to another company, McAdam Foods, and that his firm has suffered. He told MPs the scandal had led to his firm missing out on multi-million pound orders and had resulted in 31 jobs being lost in Newry. Quizzed by MPs on the Environment and Rural Affairs Committee about the horsemeat scandal, Mr Fairburn described it as a \"fraud\" and said it was \"being perpetrated by a big organisation\". He also said he suspected it had been \"going on for some time\". He told MPs that the illegal meat trade originated in other parts of Europe and did not come from the UK or Ireland. He rejected a suggestion from the Conservative MP Anne McIntosh that \"all roads lead to Ireland\". Asked if the scandal originated in Ireland, Mr Fairburn said \"not at all\". Mr Fairburn faced questioning from Conservative and Labour MPs and the South Down SDLP MP Margaret Ritchie. MPs also heard evidence from the Food Standards Agency. Tests carried out on the meat stored at Freeza Meats found that samples from the consignment contained about 80% horsemeat. It followed the discovery of horse DNA at a plant in the Republic of Ireland. Newry and Mourne Council confirmed that tests on Freeza Meats' burgers were free from horsemeat DNA. Martin McAdam, whose firm owned the contaminated meat, said there was \"clearly an issue\" with their Polish supplier.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u0000\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "<0x00>", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2"], "token_logprobs": [-0.3749912679195404, -0.01616314984858036, -0.008718520402908325, -0.006918877363204956, -0.00641288049519062, -0.006835174281150103, -0.007439764682203531, -0.00838923268020153, -0.00921366736292839, -0.010459133423864841, -0.011510980315506458, -0.013232038356363773, -0.014878380112349987, -0.01623610593378544, -0.01739812083542347, -0.018195264041423798, -0.01939043402671814, -0.02174220234155655, -0.023262567818164825, -0.024529986083507538, -0.027160605415701866, -0.02699526958167553, -0.028310813009738922, -0.030597323551774025, -0.03317076712846756, -0.03589344769716263, -0.038157545030117035, -0.04189266264438629, -0.0426613874733448, -0.0439157672226429, -0.04697319492697716, -0.04901114106178284, -0.049734946340322495, -0.051119253039360046, -0.05286591127514839, -0.05264347791671753, -0.05592048540711403, -0.05770323798060417, -0.06017214059829712, -0.060359351336956024, -0.06158142909407616, -0.0653679221868515, -0.0669444128870964, -0.06756766885519028, -0.07133471965789795, -0.07187171280384064, -0.0720924660563469, -0.07390410453081131, -0.07839100807905197, -0.07863170653581619, -0.07904782146215439, -0.08195153623819351, -0.08346669375896454, -0.08584651350975037, -0.08608224242925644, -0.09011317789554596, -0.14858315885066986, -0.16669003665447235, -0.1662694662809372, -0.15541502833366394, -0.15289223194122314, -0.14385774731636047, -0.1344987452030182, -0.13128985464572906], "top_logprobs": [{"\u00c2": -0.13128985464572906, "<0x00>": -0.09011317789554596}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move \"draconian\". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law \"another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression\". \"The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,\" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new \"information security law\" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced.

Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing \"CIA project\".

The firm explained that modules in a switch related to the electric window might have been lubricated inconsistently during manufacturing. Debris caused by wear from the electrical contact points can accumulate and cause a short-circuit. This could in turn cause the switch to overheat and melt, potentially leading to a fire. Toyota said it was not aware of any accidents caused by the glitch.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.", "request_type": "language-model-inference", "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\n70203\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c2\u00c23\u00c23\u00c2OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["<0x0A>", "7", "0", "2", "0", "3", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "\u00c2", "3", "\u00c2", "3", "\u00c2", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O", "O"], "token_logprobs": [-0.37622538208961487, -0.9308985471725464, -0.7732052206993103, -0.9024611711502075, -0.478701651096344, -1.2131364345550537, -1.3147355318069458, -0.313493013381958, -0.20822569727897644, -0.20541685819625854, -0.20727525651454926, -0.21368370950222015, -0.2256479114294052, -0.35542523860931396, -0.24594591557979584, -0.3070393204689026, -0.3145206868648529, -0.41422536969184875, -0.0997706949710846, -0.04488230496644974, -0.02450183592736721, -0.014658022671937943, -0.008939482271671295, -0.00568072684109211, -0.003925476688891649, -0.0028662097174674273, -0.002126457868143916, -0.0016365956980735064, -0.0013653251808136702, -0.001141849672421813, -0.0009497660794295371, -0.0008118432597257197, -0.0006896263221278787, -0.0005604841862805188, -0.00047779586748220026, -0.00041214076918549836, -0.00035089056473225355, -0.0003152588615193963, -0.0002775999018922448, -0.00023815179883968085, -0.00021681819634977728, -0.0001867835089797154, -0.00017379203927703202, -0.00015805903240107, -0.0001426833332516253, -0.00013350549852475524, -0.0001292145170737058, -0.0001255195093108341, -0.00011145447206217796, -9.679325739853084e-05, -8.821098163025454e-05, -8.05822346592322e-05, -7.450303382938728e-05, -7.414542778860778e-05, -7.378782902378589e-05, -6.687417771900073e-05, -6.007967749610543e-05, -5.435795901576057e-05, -4.95898348162882e-05, -4.8040190449682996e-05, -4.768258077092469e-05, -4.792098479811102e-05, -4.565611743601039e-05, -4.339123915997334e-05], "top_logprobs": [{"<0x0A>": -0.37622538208961487, "7": -0.9308985471725464, "0": -0.478701651096344, "2": -0.9024611711502075, "3": -0.24594591557979584, "\u00c2": -0.3070393204689026, "O": -4.339123915997334e-05}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
