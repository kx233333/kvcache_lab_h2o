Two late tries flattered the visitors, who have one game left before launching their World Cup campaign against Fiji on 18 September. \"We gave away penalties and our discipline was shocking,\" said Robshaw. \"Whether it was rust, or nerves, it wasn't good enough. Credit to France, they put us under pressure and made us make mistakes. \"We gave too many penalties away, but in the second half we came out and played well but couldn't quite get over the line in the end,\" he told Sky Sports. \"We can't give teams like France and other quality sides head starts like we did. \"We'll look long and hard at ourselves, because we let ourselves down in the first half. We played well in phases but you can't wait for 40 minutes to do that.\" Late tries from Danny Cipriani and Jonathan Joseph made it close on the scoreboard but Lancaster was left with much to ponder by a disappointing team display in the Stade de France. Media playback is not supported on this device The head coach, who must announce his final squad by 31 August, added: \"We've got to get our discipline at the breakdown - we can't give France easy position like we did. We need to improve on that, because all the little mistakes add up. \"The bench made a difference. It upped the energy levels and we scored some good tries. I won't gloss over what went on before that, because it was too little too late. \"There are a few players who have given me food for thought, those guys who came on and gave us the energy we needed and made a difference. \"I need to have a sleep on this game and think about my final squad. We're two weeks away from playing Ireland and four weeks away from Fiji in the World Cup and we'll expect a reaction next time.\" England host Ireland in their final World Cup warm-up game at Twickenham on 5 September. Fly-half Ford told Sky Sports: \"I thought we might snatch that at the end but we had hardly any ball in the first half and gave away too many penalties. We played some good stuff in the second-half. \"In the first half a lot of our undoing was down to ourselves. We just weren't good enough in that first half and there's no excuse for that. We let them build up the score and that made it hard for us. \"It was frustrating and we had to think of ways to adapt and that was constantly going through our minds. We tried to get ourselves out of a hole. \"We've got to turn up against Ireland now and make sure that we win. Our basics have got to be world class.\""

It started to rain when he hit the turn and he dropped his first shot of the tournament at the par-four 12th, but ground things out as others wilted. Mickelson's feats were brought into sharper focus by the efforts of playing partners Lee Westwood and Ernie Els, who started their rounds on level par.

      "text": "Comparisons will inevitably be made with the legendary centre and former Irish captain. After all, Ringrose wears the number 13, played for Blackrock, UCD, Leinster and didn't start his rugby career as a centre. But the 22-year-old new kid on the block appears destined to make a name for himself and his entry into the Six Nations fray is keenly anticipated. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt was careful not to throw Ringrose into the international arena too early. But the emerging player is regarded as a young man with a mature head in his shoulders, someone well equipped to handle hype and huge media attention. But, what makes him so special? What are the qualities that had O'Driscoll himself calling for the Leinster lad to be included in Ireland's last Six Nations campaign? \"He has been anointed the next Brian O'Driscoll. Brian was similar at that age, efficient and solid,\" says Eddie O'Sullivan, Ireland's coach from 2001 to 2008. \"Garry's trademark is he is incredibly efficient. Young players make bloopers, but he doesn't make mistakes. It's important to remain calm under pressure and then when your opportunity comes, you take it. \"Brian didn't make mistakes and then he stepped up. No-one expected him to score a try in Paris in 2000, but he scored three. \"Then no-one expected him to score that try against Australia for the Lions a year later, but he did. These are the moments. They came to him and he took them. Then he kicked on, kept improving.\" Ringrose made his senior Ireland debut in the autumn international against Canada last November, a week after being an unused replacement in that historic win over the All Blacks in Chicago. He then scored his first international try in the exciting 27-24 win over Australia in Dublin. Ringrose played his school rugby for Blackrock College in Dublin, although when he joined the senior side, he wasn't seen as one of their better players. Hopping from number nine to 15 and not being offered a permanent position, he kept his head down and eventually an injury opened up a spot at 13. After the switch, he remained their kicker and his points tally propelled Blackrock to the Leinster Senior Cup. Suddenly people were asking who this guy was and he was off to UCD with a glowing reputation. Bobby Byrne, the Director of Rugby at UCD, recalls: \"I first came across Gary in that run to the Senior Cup. He wasn't overly recognised at that stage but suddenly he was having a significant impact for the team. He is the player I am most looking forward to seeing in this year's Six Nations. \"He had composure, was an elusive runner and was really courageous. He hadn't the biggest frame, but he had a good bit of pace to finish off. \"He had, and still has, a great temperament. He is a very balanced guy. The rate of improvement since he has left school has been phenomenal. \"He has improved every year and he's conscious that he always needs to improve, so his"

      "text": "The 49-year-old Colorado native, whose legal pedigree includes Harvard and Oxford, would succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia if confirmed. He is favoured by many conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law as Scalia. Judge Gorsuch was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. Judge Gorsuch began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, the latter of whom he could now serve alongside. He worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Perhaps it was during his time in England that he accumulated what his former law partner, Mark Hansen, has said was \"an inexhaustible store\" of Winston Churchill quotes. Judge Gorsuch - who reportedly likes to fly-fish and hunt - lives in Boulder with his wife Louise and two daughters, where he is also an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado. If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the only Protestant on the current bench. The other justices are Jewish and Catholic. His family is well-connected in Republican establishment politics. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was the first female director of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Reagan administration. He is known for his clear and concise writing style, navigating the most complex legal issues as deftly as the double-black diamond slopes on which he is reputedly an expert skier in the snow-capped mountain state he calls home. Judge Gorsuch's published writings reveal his conservative leanings. He argued against euthanasia in his 2006 book The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. \"All human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong,\" he wrote. In a 2005 article in the National Review, Judge Gorsuch argued that \"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom\". He said they keep \"relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda\". Judge Gorsuch has never ruled on abortion, and he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on that issue or gay marriage. His conservative outlook cements Mr Trump's campaign promise to nominate a judge \"in the mould\" of Justice Scalia, restoring the nine-seat high court's 5-4 conservative majority. Much like the late Scalia, the Ivy-League educated judge is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. While sitting on the bench of the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch sided with groups that successfully challenged the Obama administration's requirements for employers to provide health insurance that includes contraception in the Hobby Lobby Stores"

By the end of the 80s, the graffiti culture was being forced to adapt, as by then, New York's Transit Authority had brought in procedures that made it tougher to gain access to the train yards. New models with coatings that were resistant to paint, and faster cleaning of any that were covered in graffiti also meant the artists' work was short-lived and the thrill of seeing the work trundling around the city was lost. In the years since, some of the artists have fared well in the US and Europe, others have spent time in prison, one has become a policeman and some have died. The art itself is now part of the mainstream, no longer reserved for city walls but a regular part of a designer's armoury. For Cooper, the graffiti work is an important part of her time in New York, producing the images she is most proud of, rather than those shot on assignment for newspapers or magazines. At times, she would spend hours waiting and watching, for that moment when good light combined with a powerful piece of art passing through an interesting part of the city. Chalfant approached the graffiti from a different angle, concentrating on the work itself, often shooting a series of overlapping images using the motor drive on his camera. He would then splice the pictures together in his studio. He said at the time: \"I was more interested in capturing the beautiful, ephemeral work of art than in taking a beautiful picture as a photographer.\" Here is a selection of the photographs by Cooper and Chalfant. Subway Art by Martha Cooper & Henry Chalfant is published by Thames & Hudson."

It did not belong to Freeza Meats and none of their products tested positive for horsemeat. Mr Fairburn, who is now retired, said the beef belonged to another company, McAdam Foods, and that his firm has suffered. He told MPs the scandal had led to his firm missing out on multi-million pound orders and had resulted in 31 jobs being lost in Newry. Quizzed by MPs on the Environment and Rural Affairs Committee about the horsemeat scandal, Mr Fairburn described it as a \"fraud\" and said it was \"being perpetrated by a big organisation\". He also said he suspected it had been \"going on for some time\". He told MPs that the illegal meat trade originated in other parts of Europe and did not come from the UK or Ireland. He rejected a suggestion from the Conservative MP Anne McIntosh that \"all roads lead to Ireland\". Asked if the scandal originated in Ireland, Mr Fairburn said \"not at all\". Mr Fairburn faced questioning from Conservative and Labour MPs and the South Down SDLP MP Margaret Ritchie. MPs also heard evidence from the Food Standards Agency. Tests carried out on the meat stored at Freeza Meats found that samples from the consignment contained about 80% horsemeat. It followed the discovery of horse DNA at a plant in the Republic of Ireland. Newry and Mourne Council confirmed that tests on Freeza Meats' burgers were free from horsemeat DNA. Martin McAdam, whose firm owned the contaminated meat, said there was \"clearly an issue\" with their Polish supplier."

Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move \"draconian\". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law \"another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression\". \"The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,\" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new \"information security law\" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to \"cheat\" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's \"internet guru\", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. \"The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person\", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing \"CIA project\". He also claimed that"

Toyota has already recalled some 10 million cars globally that were fitted with faulty air bags linked to a number of deaths. The defective window switch affects models including the Yaris model as well as the Corolla, Camry, RAV4, Highlander and others. The recall only affects cars produced between 2005 and 2010. Of the total, about 2.7 million cars were sold in North America, 1.2 million in Europe, and 600,000 in Japan, the company said. The firm explained that modules in a switch related to the electric window might have been lubricated inconsistently during manufacturing. Debris caused by wear from the electrical contact points can accumulate and cause a short-circuit. This could in turn cause the switch to overheat and melt, potentially leading to a fire.

The prize was Europe's biggest ever and was capped after a series of rollovers. On the night of the draw Chris was checking their numbers on the BBC's Red Button digital text service about midnight on the television in their bedroom. \"I started circling the numbers I had matched but wasn't doing very well. Then on the fifth line, all the circles seemed to join up.\" The telephone line run by Camelot for claims was closed. Chris and husband Colin sat up all night they were so excited. \"When we first realised we had won, it felt like a dream,\" Colin said. \"Everything went into slow motion.\" Life changing When asked at a media conference in Falkirk what they will do with the money, Chris said: \"We're not flashy people.\" \"The next steps are going to be the most difficult... with great wealth comes great responsibility,\" added Colin. The Weirs have both had serious health conditions in recent years and have not been able to work. Colin, 64, had previously worked as a television cameraman and Chris, 55, is a fully-trained psychiatric nurse. The most exciting aspect of their windfall is the opportunity to travel. \"We have both always wanted to see the Great Wall of China and Colin would love to stand at the foot of Ayers Rock in Australia,\" said Chris. \"We also love art galleries, so this gives us the chance to visit those in Paris and in Russia.

UK winning streak Before Tuesday's draw, the largest lottery winner in the UK was the player who claimed \u00a3113m in the Euromillions last October and chose to remain anonymous. The couple have displaced former postal worker Angela Kelly from East Kilbride, who became Scotland's biggest winner in August 2007 when she scooped \u00a335,425,411.80 in the Euromillions jackpot. Britons have banked the Euromillions jackpot more than 14 times in the last two years. Last year, two anonymous UK winners scooped \u00a3113m and \u00a384m. And Nigel and Justine Page, from Gloucestershire, won the \u00a356m jackpot prize on EuroMillions in February 2010. National Lottery operator Camelot runs the Euromillions draw in the UK and has also had the same role for the weekly Lotto draw since it was launched in 1994. The firm says that its draws have created about 2,400 lottery millionaires in the UK in the intervening 17 years. If the winner of Tuesday's draw had been a single player, he or she would instantly have been placed 430th in this year's Sunday Times Rich List just above Scottish businessman Sir Angus Grossart and Irina Abramovich, the former wife of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.

Rebecca Hilsenrath, head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the remarks were \"truly disgusting\" as well as unlawful. Mr Wilson said it was \"not a colour issue\" but an \"economic judgement\". Speaking to BBC Asian Network, Mr Wilson, who has amassed nearly 1,000 buy-to-let properties in Kent, said a property he had bought from an Indian couple cost him about \u00c2\u00a312,000 because the curry smell became a \"massive problem\" and he was forced to rip up the carpet and take the house off the market for six months. \"If that makes me racist, that makes 99% of people who buy houses racist,\" he said. \"How many white people are going to go into a house that smells of curry and are going to buy [it]?\" The Equality and Human Rights Commission is investigating and says it will seek legal action where necessary. Ms Hilsenrath said: \"There are still deep inequalities in our society as our race report demonstrated and these comments show why. \"As a country we all assume we have left the dark ages behind, but clearly there is more to be done. \"We will investigate and will be asking Mr Wilson to explain his actions. Unless we are satisfied that he will not break the law in the future we will take legal action\". Kent Police also said it was working to establish if any offences had taken place. In the past, Mr Wilson evicted all 200 of his housing benefit tenants, saying he would rather have \"migrants as tenants than people on benefits\"."

The new organisation will manage funding for universities, further education colleges, research and skills. It will also seek to improve links between higher and further education and Welsh business. Publishing the white paper on Tuesday, Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said the aim was to make it \"easier for people to learn and acquire skills throughout their careers\". \"Our lives and economy are undergoing huge technological change,\" she said, adding: \"Our national mission does not stop at the school gates. \"We need to ensure that those leaving our schools progress into a post-compulsory system which provides genuine parity of esteem for vocational and academic routes and which equips them with the skills required for sustainable and rewarding careers. \"Such a workforce will allow our economy to be more productive and competitive and our people more prosperous and secure.\""

Many had expected Mr Scioli to lead by a greater margin. The run-off on 22 November will be the first time an Argentine election will be decided by a second round. With 96% of the votes counted, Mr Scioli was marginally ahead with 36.7% of the vote, while Mr Macri had 34.5%. To win outright in the first round, a candidate needed 45% of the vote or a minimum of 40% as well as a 10-point lead over the nearest rival. \"What happened today will change politics in this country,\" Mr Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires, told supporters. Sergio Massa, a former ally turned rival of outgoing President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, came a distant third with 21.3% of the vote and admitted defeat. Mr Massa has not said who will get his backing in the second round next month. With Mr Macri and Mr Scioli neck-and-neck, Mr Massa's support could prove crucial. Mr Scioli was handpicked as candidate by President Fernandez, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. The governor of Buenos Aires province, he is a former world powerboating champion who lost his right arm in a race in 1989. Late on Sunday, he spoke before thousands of his supporters, saying: \"United together we will triumph. I call upon the undecided and independent voters to join this cause.\" Last week, Mr Scioli pledged tax cuts for workers earning under a certain income, a move expected to affect half a million people. He has also vowed to bring down Argentina's inflation to single digits in less than four years and promises to introduce policy changes to invigorate the economy. Ms Fernandez, who stands down after eight years in power, says she leaves Argentines a better country. \"We are voting today in a completely normal country,\" said Ms Fernandez said after casting her vote in the Patagonian town of Rio Gallegos. In previous decades, Argentines always went to the polls \"in the middle of a serious crisis,\" she added. Ms Fernandez said achieving stability and leaving Argentines \"a normal country\" was the promise made by her late husband, Neston Kirchner, when he took office in 2003. He died in 2010, three years after handing over the presidency to his wife. Argentina elections: All to play for 14.5% Official, but disputed, inflation level 28.2% the inflation level in 2014, according to the World Bank 0.7% amount IMF predicts the economy will shrink in 2016 Whoever wins the presidency faces significant economic challenges. While the country gained strength after a financial crisis in 2002, its economy, the third-largest in Latin America, has slowed in recent years, with GDP growing by only 0.5% last year. The government is also locked in a battle against American hedge funds who disagree with how it wants to restructure $100bn (\u00c2\u00a365bn) of debt on which it defaulted in 2001. While the firms successfully sued Argentina for repayment, Ms Fernandez refused to pay."

The third in line to the throne and future king turns one on 22 July. The design of the sterling silver piece was approved by his parents; his great-grandmother the Queen; and Chancellor George Osborne. It bears the heraldic royal arms and the year 2014. Prince George was photographed at the weekend walking with the help of his mother. Shane Bissett, director of commemorative coin and bullion at the Royal Mint, said: \"We felt there could be no more fitting design to mark the first birthday of our future king than the royal arms - the arms of the monarch - minted in honour of the future heir to the throne. \"The choice of a silver coin is significant too, as the precious metal is closely associated with newborn babies... \"Crossing the palm of a newborn baby with silver is a way to wish them wealth and good health throughout their life, whilst the \u00a35 coin is a favourite for royal celebrations.\" The coins will be a limited mintage of 7,500 and will cost \u00a380 each from the Royal Mint. The heraldic royal arms incorporates the four quarterings of the royal arms, each contained in a shield, as well as a rose, thistle, leek, a sprig of shamrock and a crown. It was originally created for the Queen and was last used on a coin struck for the British Exhibition in New York in 1960. George's birth and his christening were also marked with commemorative coins."

The archives also show UK Treasury concern at overfunding of Scotland and Northern Ireland under the Barnett formula, a political issue to this day. In the mid-1980s, Wales secured one fifth of inward investment into the UK despite having only 5% of the population. But with the then Conservative government trying to cut public spending, the Treasury tried to cut back regional spending in England. That could have hit the Welsh Office budget and the secretary of state Nicholas Edwards joined his Scottish counterpart George Younger to protest. In a letter to the Treasury chief secretary (and fellow Welshman) Peter Rees - copied to the prime minister - Mr Edwards complained about the implications for his budget. He wrote: \"I agree strongly with the points George Younger has made in his letter. They apply equally in the three territories. The political effects in Wales, as in Scotland, would be most damaging.\" Mr Edwards demanded to be present at meetings between the Treasury and Department for Trade and Industry when the issue was discussed. The archives do not record any reply and Mr Edwards - now Lord Crickhowell - cannot recall the episode. But, in another parallel with today's politics, the archives show Treasury concern at overfunding of Scotland and Northern Ireland under the so-called Barnett formula that is also used to calculate changes in the Welsh budget. Peter Rees, later Lord Rees of Goytre, wrote to Mrs Thatcher: \"Even our predecessors never saw it as any more than a stop-gap arrangement on the road to political devolution, certainly not as the permanency it has now become. \"Be that as it may, the block system is now publicly construed, in the territories, as apolitical entitlement to public expenditure. The longer we let it run the harder it becomes to challenge that perception, and the greater the risk of political repercussion when we do. \" MP David Willetts, then a Downing Street adviser, wrote: \"Scotland and NI have their snouts well and truly in the public expenditure trough. The challenge is to find a politically acceptable way of putting them on the same diet as the English.\" The files reveal that the Treasury considered suspending the formula. Mr Rees wrote to Mrs Thatcher: \"The 'fallback' approach to securing savings is to suspend the operation of the comparability formulae for the Scottish and Northern Ireland blocks - though not for Wales, where over-provision is not suspected.\" Thirty years on, the UK political parties have vowed to keep the formula as part of a deal to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom. Mrs Thatcher's ministers considered launching the controversial poll tax in Wales before England, according to other files just released. The documents released by the National Archives also show Conservative government advisers feared a repeat of the 1984-85 miners' strike the following winter.

The SGA has called for a public inquiry into the impact of the reintroduction of the birds on the east coast. RSPB Scotland has described the small child claim as \"alarmist nonsense\". The Scottish government said it was not aware of any attacks by sea eagles on children in other countries and did not think a public inquiry was necessary. In a letter to the Scottish government, the SGA warned that the attack on the Very Reverend Hunter Farquharson in Abernethy, in Perthshire, could be the first of many. The association has asked for the formulation of an \"exit strategy\" if the sea eagles turn out to have an adverse effect on social, economic or leisure activities. In the letter, the SGA said: \"These creatures are being released into what is a comparatively densely populated area so they will come into contact with humans on a daily basis. \"That will instil habituated behaviour and remove what should be a healthy fear of humans. \"There are reports of buzzards which have obviously undergone this desensitisation and this has resulted in them attacking people. This could pose a serious threat in the future. \"Will these very large creatures differentiate between a small child and more natural quarry?\" The Perth-based SGA represents gamekeepers, stalkers, ghillies, wildlife managers and rangers. Association committee member Bert Burnett said the group did not have a problem with sea eagles on Scotland's west coast. He said: \"As far as we are concerned these sea eagles seem to be doing fine and not posing a threat.\" However, Mr Burnett said more consultation was needed on the release of the birds on the east coast. He added: \"Some might think this is gamekeepers making a fuss for some obscure reason. \"That's not the case. It is a genuine concern and it is a concern felt by other people out there other than gamekeepers.\" On the micro blogging website Twitter, RSPB Scotland tweeted: \"Alarmist nonsense from the SGA. \"Sea eagle could soon be eating small children. Surely ScotGov won't take this seriously.\" A spokesman for RSPB Scotland said the Perthshire incident was unfortunate and regrettable but that the bird had reacted as other wild animals might do when cornered. He said the SGA claim about eagles, the UK's largest bird of prey, targeting small children as ridiculous. With a wing span of 8ft, the white-tailed sea eagle is the UK's largest bird of prey. It was completely wiped out in Britain in the early 20th Century and only returned when a reintroduction programme began on the island of Rum in 1975. Mull, Wester Ross and Skye also now have established populations. In August this year, a new batch of 16 young sea eagles were released in Fife. A Scottish government said the raptors were widespread in many parts of Europe, including densely populated areas. A spokeswoman said: \"We are not aware of any attacks"

The claim was made on the first day of a two-week review into some of the most controversial killings of the Troubles. The review is looking at 56 cases involving 97 deaths. They include killings by police officers and soldiers, and others where there are allegations of state collusion. A senior judge, Lord Justice Weir, is assessing what more needs to be done before inquests can be held to establish what happened. In his opening remarks, the judge said he hopes the review \"will shed some light on the cases without producing too much heat\". The review began with a discussion about so-called \"shoot to kill cases\", when RUC officers shot dead six unarmed republicans. A number of lawyers said the time taken by the police to disclose classified documents was the reason inquests had not yet taken place. A barrister for the PSNI said it simply does not have the resources to deal with the vast amount of material relating to legacy cases. But, a lawyer for the families of two of the men who were shot dead said they believe the PSNI is deliberately dragging its heels. Barry McDonald QC said the lack of disclosure of material by the PSNI was the biggest single impediment to the inquests taking place. \"Any time there is light at the end of the tunnel for the families, the PSNI extends the tunnel,\" he told the court. The killings of 10 unarmed Catholic civilians by the army in Ballymurphy in August 1971 were also discussed on Monday. It was revealed that the Ministry of Defence has told lawyers representing the families of those who were killed that it cannot identify the soldiers who were on duty in Ballymurphy at the time of the shootings. The court was told that so far, the Army has only managed to trace one soldier. Lord Justice Weir stressed the importance of the army witnesses being found. \"At the end of the day, we want to hear about the circumstances in which these people were shot, and those best placed to do that are those who shot them,\" he said. The judge said it was in everyone's interests that the soldiers who were there and fired shots came forward and explained why they did so. Lord Justice Weir has been asked to report on the state of readiness of each of the 56 legacy cases, and to identify which, if any, can proceed to inquest hearings. It will then be up to the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan, to decide what happens next. Likening the legacy inquests to spinning plates, the judge said \"there simply aren't enough resources to spin all of the plates all of the time\". He said he hopes the two week review will lead to an agreement about \"which plates need to spin more urgently\"."

I didn't really think they would die, I just thought they would be injured or go back home, but they passed away and obviously that was a big shock to us and I didn't know how to take that,\" he said. \"I became a bit scared then. I didn't know what to think or what my next step would be. Because it happened to me twice and I thought it will happen to me third time unlucky.\" The Ministry of Defence citation when he received his medal said: \"With no regard for his own safety and with his focus firmly on saving those in the vehicle, he commenced the evacuation of the casualties from the burning chaos.\" What is PTSD? Post-traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder caused by witnessing or being involved in a frightening or distressing event. People naturally feel afraid when in danger, but the legacy of some traumatic events is a change in perception of fear. They may feel stressed or frightened in day-to-day life. Diagnosing PTSD But Mr Smith, now 31, blames himself for not being able to save his friends and does not think he deserves the medal. In fact, he does not really remember being awarded it by Prince Charles. \"I didn't really take it all in, I was very numb that day because I was on medication anyway so my mood and my temperament wasn't the best,\" he says. Figures from veterans' mental health charity Combat Stress show Mr Smith is not alone. It has seen a 28% increase in veterans seeking mental health support from April 2014 to 2015, treble the 9% increase seen the year before. Almost 6,000 are registered with the charity, and it says it has never been busier in its 97-year history. Mr Smith"

Most made it back safely, but for some the journey ended in tragedy. \"An event like this is hard to forget,\" says Eleni Karavelatzi. \"It leaves you seared with scars and makes you bitter forever.\" Eleni Karavelatzi was 12 months old when in 1942 her family fled the Nazi occupation of Kastelorizo, a Greek island 2km (1.5 miles) from the Turkish coast. They sailed first to Cyprus and then to a refugee camp in Gaza known as El Nuseirat. They stayed there until the end of the war. In September 1945, a British vessel, the SS Empire Patrol, left the Egyptian city of Port Said carrying Eleni's family and 500 other Greek refugees. Within hours, fire broke out onboard. Thirty-three passengers died, including 14 children. From her garden on Kastelorizo, Eleni can now see the EU border agency ship searching for new migrants and reminisces about what happened in 1945. \"My parents told me that I was tied with a rope and lowered on to a raft. But as they were letting me down, my father saw that it was full and ordered me back. As soon as I was brought up, a woman jumped on the dinghy. It capsized and all the children drowned.\" Among the victims were Eleni's three cousins, whose names are carved on a monument a short distance from where she lives. To the east of the monument lives Kastelorizo's only other survivor, Maria Chroni, who lives with her granddaughter. Maria Chroni, who was born in 1937, clung for life on a piece of wreckage. \"I found myself at sea holding on to a wooden plank.\" \"How it happened, I can't remember. I only know I that I stayed in this position for 10 hours. Then my father rescued me and lifted me into the charred boat.\" From Aleppo to Egypt and beyond Other Greek refugees had fled the Nazi occupation to Syria. They were mainly from the island of Chios, a few kilometres off the Turkey coast. \"The Germans were here and we were hungry. I was three back then,\" remembers Marianthi Andreadi. \"So we left for Turkey illegally and from there we took the train to Al Nayrab camp in Aleppo (Syria).\" Marianthi remembers some of the faces that stood out on her journey. \"I was surrounded by older women. And there was this moment that stays with me when we were on the Turkish border and the guard yells 'Gel Burda! Gel Burda!' (come here).\" \"We ran away quickly. I fell down. And eventually he let us go. But I never forgot this.\" Greek archives reveal Al Nayrab camp was less a permanent settlement than a meeting point, says Iakovos Michailidis, professor of history at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. \"People were brought here for short periods of time before being sent to various parts of the Middle East, or even Africa.\" Ioannis Stekas"

It gave them a 2-0 T20 series win to go with their 3-2 one-day series victory. \"The first half of the trip was very exciting,\" Bayliss said. \"But we got worse as the series went on, and South Africa got better.\" England won the four-match Test series 2-1 and took a 2-0 lead in the one-day international contest, before losing the final five fixtures on the tour (three ODIs and two T20s). Their batting collapsed dramatically at the Wanderers, with seven wickets falling for 14 runs and the bowlers were then subjected to an onslaught from De Villiers and Hashim Amla, who took their team to 121-0 after just eight overs. The South Africans struck 16 fours and nine sixes, with Amla unbeaten on 69 from 38 balls. Such an emphatic defeat was ominous for England, who begin their ICC World Twenty20 campaign against West Indies in Mumbai on 16 March and face South Africa two days later. \"It's a bit of a reminder for people at home not to get too far ahead of themselves,\" Bayliss admitted. \"We have played some good cricket, but this is a young group of players and performances like this will happen from time to time.\" The tourists changed their team for Sunday's match at the Wanderers, bringing in batsman Sam Billings for bowling all-rounder David Willey. \"In India we'll definitely be playing two spinners, so we just wanted to try having that extra batter, which we've done before, and just the five bowlers,\" Bayliss added. Asked about the effects of a long tour he added: \"I'm sure fatigue had a very small part to do with it, probably more mental than anything else. We've been away for five months apart from a week in between, when you count the UAE. \"But that's something these young players have got to get used to and if that's part of the learning curve for these young guys, there's something to learn from.\" England skipper Eoin Morgan, who was run out at the non striker's end for 38, lamented: \"Quite simply, we underperformed. \"The majority of our batting went really well - we were on course to get 185, 190, possibly 200. \"Myself and Jos Buttler were going really well, then we lost two wickets in two balls, and then from there we lost six wickets in the space of no time. I don't think we were too far behind the game, but the way we started with the ball allowed South Africa to get on top. \"The inconsistency is because we are inexperienced, and that is going to come. With that comes a great brand of cricket that is really exciting and can beat any side in the world.\""

SFA chief executive Stewart Regan said McClair \"has been at the cutting edge of coaching evolution, analysis and performance management\". McClair, who takes over the role following the departure of Dutchman Mark Wotte, spent almost 30 years at Old Trafford as a player, youth coach and director of the youth academy. The SFA said he \"was identified unanimously as preferred candidate during a recruitment process which involved the current Scotland national coach, Gordon Strachan, previous national coaches Walter Smith and Andy Roxburgh, as well as the Scottish FA's chief executive, Stewart Regan\". McClair begins in the role on 1 June and will be responsible for implementing the SFA's performance strategy. He added: \"I am extremely proud to have been given the responsibility to help Scottish football move forward as performance director of the Scottish FA. \"Having spent the majority of the last 30 years in England with Manchester United, I am looking forward to coming home, working with the coaching team at the Scottish FA and the clubs, and sharing the knowledge I have built up in that time to take on this new, exciting challenge.\" Having started his playing career at Motherwell, McClair moved to Celtic in 1983 and went on to score 126 goals in 204 matches. He then joined Manchester United, where he made 471 appearances between 1987 and 1998. He scored 126 goals for the Old Trafford side and won four Premier League titles, one European Cup-winners' Cup, one European Super Cup, three FA Cups and one League Cup. \"The process of identifying a new performance director was thorough and hugely uplifting when we considered the quality of candidates,\" Regan added. \"Brian very quickly became a stand-out with his blend of experiences, not just from his trophy-laden career as a player at Manchester United, and his international contribution, but the depth of his coaching experiences with one of the biggest and most successful teams in the world. \"He has been at the cutting edge of coaching evolution, analysis and performance management at Manchester United and the recruitment panel were convinced he was the ideal person to lead the performance strategy into an exciting new era, enhancing the current provision while demonstrating the benefits of the investment so far to the future of Scottish football.\""

The announcement comes as Beijing tries to overhaul the steel industry, one of the country's bloated state sectors. The merger will create a new company, China Baowu Iron and Steel Group. Based on data from 2015, the two firms together have an annual production of about 60 million tonnes a year, which would make it the country's largest steelmaker. Globally, it would be second only to Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal. Baosteel's net profit tumbled 83% to 1bn yuan ($150m) last year, while Wuhan lost 7.5bn yuan, a sharp drop from its 1.3bn yuan net profit in 2014. Steel demand in China, as well as worldwide, has slumped in the past year as the country's economic growth has slowed. The resulting overproduction has seen steelmakers around the world suffer huge losses. China has been accused of price dumping - selling its steel cheaply overseas in order to clear its stocks. In April, China promised to reduce its steel output, following a crisis meeting attended by 30 nations. Over the past 25 years, Chinese steel production has expanded hugely with output growing more than twelve-fold. China produced more than 822 million tonnes of steel in 2014 and is expected to produce even more this year. However, projected demand for its steel in 2016 is only 672 million tonnes."

A member of teaching staff in north Wales was given \u00a3100,000 compensation when the chair he sat on collapsed. The NASUWTteaching union said it had won \u00a316,077,328 for members last year. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"School employers are responsible for the health and safety of staff and pupils whether the local authority, governing body or academy trust, and they must adhere to the Health and Safety Act 1974.\" Teachers also received smaller payouts over accidents in the workplace, including a \u00a355,000 package for a female member of staff in north-west England who tripped on a tear in the lino surface of her science classroom. She was later diagnosed with chronic back syndrome. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said many of the injuries would be reduced if employers \"took the welfare of staff seriously\" and followed good health and safety practices. She said: \"The consequence of negligence is careers, lives and health blighted and millions of pounds of public money spent in compensation. \"Unfortunately, there is no incentive for employers to take health and welfare seriously when they witness the government cutting funding for inspection and failing to take steps to secure compliance with the law. \"Failure to respect the rights of employees and to comply with employment law is also prevalent. \"Employers flout the law, but it's the teachers and the taxpayers who pay the price. \"While compensation is important, it can never make up for the fact that teachers suffer permanent physical and mental injury and often cannot continue in their chosen career.\" Separate data from the NUT, which keeps its overall compensation figures private, said there were two cases of personal injury compensation paid to its members last year. One included a \u00a346,000 payout to a teacher who suffered \"severe psychological injury\" following \"a sustained campaign of bullying and harassment by senior leadership\". Another NUT member was awarded just under \u00a34,500 after she fractured a finger on a defective doorknob, causing her long-term aches and a deformity. The union said it offered legal help in 130 cases last year, including 71 involving criminal activity and 57 in employment cases."

Dorset Police and Natural England have launched an investigation. Natural England is urging any restaurants or pubs to ask to see a valid licence before buying eggs to prepare in meals. Birds of Poole Harbour had been surveying a group of islands in the harbour when the theft was discovered. Mediterranean gulls are classified as a Schedule One species, meaning anyone disturbing their nests must have a special licence. Paul Morton, who runs the charity, said Mediterranean gulls' eggs were not approved for human consumption, and could be a \"health issue\". \"I'm distraught, really.

But the decision was not without controversy, sparking outrage among both UN members and women's rights advocates across the world. More than 1,000 of anonymous and \"concerned\" UN staff members have signed an online petition arguing that Wonder Woman was not an appropriate choice, noting the character's physique as: \"a large breasted, white woman of impossible proportions, scantily clad in a shimmery, thigh-baring body suit with an American flag motif and knee high boots -the epitome of a \"pin-up\" girl\". Critics who signed the petition said it was \"disappointing\" that the UN \"was unable to find a real-life woman that would be able to champion the rights of ALL women on the issue of gender equality and the fight for their empowerment\". The comic book superhero has sprung back into culture relevance with the upcoming release of a new Wonder Woman film starring Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who appeared at the UN ceremony along with actress Lynda Carter, who also portrayed her in the eponymous 1970s US TV series. Wonder Woman, an Amazonian princess who was created by Harvard-trained psychologist William Moulton Marston in 1941, was inspired by the leaders of the suffragist movement and has been long considered a feminist icon. \"The focus [of the UN] was on her feminist background, being the first female superhero in a world of male superheroes and that basically she always fought for fairness, justice and peace,\" UN official Maher Nasser told NPR. The organisation said the character's appointment was meant to \"highlight what we can collectively achieve if women and girls are empowered\" and \"to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\", according to the UN's website on sustainable development goals. But the honour appeared to be ill-timed. The announcement follows the UN's selection of Portugal's Antonio Guterres as its next Secretary General despite a global push for the organisation to select its first female top diplomat. In fact, a recent analysis found that nine of 10 senior leadership roles at the UN went to men. Prospective female candidates in the race included the former prime minister of New Zealand, the director general of cultural agency Unesco, the Moldovan deputy prime minister and a senior EU official. Why wasn't a woman elected as UN secretary general? \"It is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualized image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls,\" the petition read. About 100 UN staff members protested the appointment at UN headquarters, bearing signs emblazoned with the words: \"I am not a mascot\" and \"Let's get real\". Outrage reverberated across social media, with women's rights advocates pointing to real-life women who fit the bill over Wonder Woman. France's highest-ranking female Cabinet minister, Segolene Royal, told CBS \"Nobel Peace"

In 2009, he grabbed the microphone from Taylor Swift as she tried to accept a prize at the VMAs. Beck, who also won best rock album, performed a duet with Coldplay's Chris Martin. Taylor Swift got a hand with her dress on the red carpet. She missed out on the awards for record of the year and song of the year. The big-name pair-ups included Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, who performed Irving Berlin's Cheek To Cheek. Rihanna arrived in a pink layered dress by Giambattista Valli. Katy Perry mingled with fans before swapping fashion tips (possibly) with Rihanna. Perry then changed clothes - and hair - to perform her ballad By the Grace of God as part of a poignant segment highlighting domestic abuse. Kanye West appeared in a single spotlight to perform Only One, which he wrote with Sir Paul McCartney. He later returned with Sir Paul and Rihanna to perform their joint collaboration FourFiveSeconds. Jessie J and Sir Tom Jones, former co-stars on The Voice UK, got together for a duet of You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'. Charli XCX (left) and Iggy Azalea were up for record of the year for their hit Fancy - but lost out to Sam Smith. Beyonce won three awards and also sang the gospel standard Take My Hand, Precious Lord. Rita Ora warmed up for her performance at the Oscars later this month with an appearance at the Grammys. Hard rock legends AC/DC opened the ceremony with Rock or Bust and Highway to Hell. Recalling his Oscar-winning film role in Ray a decade ago, Jamie Foxx (right) got into character as Ray Charles as he joined Stevie Wonder to present the prize for record of the year."

I had prepared for that but at times there was quite a bit of undue criticism of the team,\" adds the Down boss. \"Whenever I took the job, I lost maybe eight or 10 players and they were the most experienced players in the panel. \"So you are starting from scratch as such. You are having to start and build a panel and you are bringing in young and inexperienced players who might have played at minor and under-21 level. \"There is a massive step up from under-21 to having to play at senior level. But we worked away, we kept our heads down, we introduced quite a few players and the ball is starting to roll in the right direction for us.\" Burns believes the concluding league draw in Cork which kept Down in Division Two as Derry and Fermanagh suffered the drop was a key moment in his team's development. \"We knew we were going to have to get something when we were down there and it had been a long time since Down had got anything in Cork. \"We had a tough second half with them but we battled it out and the result kept us in Division Two and gave us a platform to build on in the lead-in to the championship.\" Despite avoiding the drop to join Armagh in Division Three, Down still went into the Ulster derby against the Orchard County on 4 June as underdogs but the Mournemen produced a composed second-half display to earn a deserved 0-15 to 2-7 victory. \"We knew if we performed on the day that we had a massive chance of beating Armagh. That result gave us a great boost and then we had another great win against Monaghan.\" Burns' matter of fact description of belies the emotion he showed at the final whistle of the provincial semi-final in the Athletic Grounds as he emotionally embraced the Down county secretary Sean Og McAteer. \"I think there are a couple of of pictures of me hugging him.

A UK team has scanned each of its 360 bones into a computer and has digitally reconstructed the dinosaur. The specimen, nicknamed \"Sophie\", has been acquired by the Natural History Museum in London. Although Stegosauruses are one of the most well known dinosaurs, they are among those that scientists know the least about. There are only six partial skeletons of the creature, which lived around 150 million years ago. It could grow to the size of a minibus and the gigantic plates which ran along its back were its most distinctive feature. Surprisingly, it was 100 years ago that the dinosaur's skeleton was properly assessed and scientifically described. Now, using medical imaging techniques and 3D modelling, researchers at the Natural History Museum hope to learn much more about this iconic creature. Prof Paul Barrett, who is leading the research, said that they were particularly interested in finding out what stegosauruses used their plates for. \"We want to find out whether they were used for defence or whether they were used as a radiator to help the animal pick up or lose heat,\" he told BBC News. Sophie is 80% complete and is thought to be the most complete specimen in the world. Dr Charlotte Brassey, who is working with Prof Barrett, helped to scan in its 360 bones and digitally recreate it on her computer as a detailed 3D model. \"I reconstructed the skeleton to see what it might have looked like and then began to reconstruct the muscles and how they connected with the skeleton. From that we can begin to say how effective its muscles were and eventually in the future we would like to reconstruct how it moved,\" she told BBC News. Among the mysteries the researchers would like to solve is how the species was able to walk with such small front legs and such large back legs. Follow Pallab on Twitter"

The SMC approved the drug after hearing that patients tended to be younger women with family and work commitments. Cancer Research UK said trials have shown that olaparib can extend lives by an average of seven months. Olaparib is already approved for use in England for people who are suffering with cancer for a third time. In Scotland, it will be used by women who have relapsed with cancer for a second time. Katherine Taylor, chief executive of research charity Ovarian Cancer Action, said: \"The SMC's decision to approve the routine use of olaparib is ground-breaking; a huge leap towards more personalised treatment for women facing ovarian cancer because of a genetic mutation.\" The drug targets ovarian cancer in women with a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene mutation. Last year Angelina Jolie had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after she was found to be at an increased risk of ovarian cancer due to a \"faulty\" BRCA 1 gene. Ms Taylor warned that women in Scotland would only qualify for olaparib if their BRCA status is known. She said: \"NHS Scotland must continue to make sure that all patients are offered a BRCA test at diagnosis so they can be treated with the best drugs available.\" Gregor McNie, of Cancer Research UK in Scotland, said the charity was also funding clinical trials to asses the potential for olaparib in the treatment of brain tumours and pancreatic cancer. He added: \"Cancer Research UK scientists played a pivotal role in discovering and developing olaparib and it is great news that the drug will now offer new hope to some women in Scotland with advanced disease. \"We look forward to further good news on olaparib in the future, with clinical trials showing it also has potential in other types of cancer.\" Olaparib was approved by the SMC after being considered by its Patient Clinician Engagement (PACE) process which is used for medicines that treat end of life and very rare conditions. Prof Jonathan Fox, chairman of the SMC, said: \"As the first maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer, olaparib is an important development, and we know from the evidence given by patients and clinicians through our PACE process that it will be welcomed.\""

McColgan said she felt excited to see her last record broken by Muir. She had earlier raised concerns about whether Muir's race had met all the criteria set by UK Athletics for record-breaking attempts. She had told BBC radio's John Beattie programme it needed to be a \"genuine race\" and may not have been as \"Muir had been the only competitor\". \"It was a mixed 3K race where all the other girls ran 3K and it was only Laura who finished the 5K,\" she said. \"We were wondering if to get a record ratified you have to have drug testing as well. \"So we were just wondering if they had everything in place to actually have it ratified as a record.\" However, British Athletics confirmed Muir's time was expected to be classified as official. A spokesman said: \"The time will undergo ratification but is expected to be confirmed\". Rules stipulate that if there is no doping control at an event where a British record is set, there is no requirement for the athlete to submit drug tests. McColgan said Muir had what it took to win world medals. \"To run 14.49 indoors is pretty good,\" she said. \"But she is a 3.55 minute 1,500m runner, so you would expect someone like Laura to run (5K) in something like 14.30. \"So there's still a lot more in the tank and I don't think that's the fastest 5K she's ever going to run. \"She's got the ability to get down to 14.30, which is really mixing it with the top in the world.\" McColgan said Muir's race, which saw her lap other runners, had been similar to her own record-breaking race 25 years ago. \"I ran on my own right from the start with nobody really pushing me at all,\" she said. \"I actually lapped a young Paula Radcliffe about two or three times.\" McColgan said it was a bonus that her record was beaten by a fellow Scot. \"She is world class,\" she said. \"She just needs to get her race tactics right so that she can start winning some medals.\" Muir broke her own British 1500m record at the Diamond League meeting in Paris in August and reached the 1,500m Olympic final at Rio 2016."

Wiltshire Police began an investigation after being alerted by the parachute club at Netheravon Airfield to concerns over what had happened.

A suspect appeared in court on Friday and was charged with the murder of the popular goalkeeper. Meyiwa's death shocked South Africa and has highlighted the high rates of violent crime in the country. The funeral took place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Meyiwa's hometown of Durban. Many of the mourners were wearing T-shirts with a picture of Meyiwa, who was widely seen as an inspiring figure. Others wore red or black replica football shirts in the colours of Meyiwa's team, Orlando Pirates. Meyiwa's coffin was driven into the stadium, followed by Orlando Pirates players and officials. Mourners cried as videos were played showing Meyiwa training and playing football. Celebrating Senzo Meyiwa's life was the main theme for the tens of thousands of fans who packed into the stands. Fans from his team, the Orlando Pirates, but also from their rivals, the Kaiser Chiefs, sung Senzo's praises - both his ability on the pitch, and his behaviour off it. But there were also posters calling for justice for his killers, and a tougher stance from the South African authorities over gun-related violence. Underlying everything was a sense of injustice that one of Africa's most promising football talents could be killed in such a way. The chairman of the country's football association said he hoped that this could be a \"turning-point\" in the long-running debate over violent crime. And Senzo Meyiwa's father Sam told me he wanted more random searches, to cut the number of guns in South Africa. \"We are no longer safe in our houses,\" he said. \"The entire nation is crying. We have all lost. Our condolences to Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana,\" said Durban Mayor James Nxumalo, AFP reported, using a nickname for South Africa's national team. \"Our hearts are bleeding.\" President Zuma ordered the national flag to be flown at half-mast on Saturday to honour the goalkeeper. Following Meyiwa's death, South Africa's domestic football league postponed this weekend's scheduled Johannesburg derby between Orlando Pirates and rivals Kaiser Chiefs. The Durban stadium was also named as the venue for host South Africa's next Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. The funeral of another South African sporting hero, former 800m world champion Mbulaeni Mulaudzi, also took place on Saturday. Mulaudzi was killed in a car accident the day before Meyiwa's death. Police said on Friday that a suspect had been identified in Meyiwa's killing after an identity parade. The man, named as Zanokuhle Mbatha, 25, faced charges of murder and armed robbery at a court hearing and is due to appear again on 11 November. Police had offered a reward for information on the attack. \"There are still other suspects outstanding and we appeal to the public to continue providing information in support of the investigation,\" a police statement said."

The most disadvantaged pupils in Shanghai match the maths test results of wealthy pupils in the UK. Mr Schleicher says it \"debunks the myth that poverty is destiny\". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove said individual schools in England should take Pisa tests, so that they could compare themselves against international standards. The latest Pisa - Programme for International Student Assessment - test results were published last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranking developed countries in terms of how well 15-year-olds performed in tests in reading, maths and science. Source: OECD This showed the UK as a middle-ranking country, with Asian school systems, such as in Singapore, South Korea and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, as the highest performers. But Mr Schleicher's latest analysis compares the performance of the most deprived 10% of pupils. This reveals how the poorest in many countries overlap with the results of the wealthy in other countries. The poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers taking the test in the UK and the United States. In Europe, the Netherlands has the highest-performing pupils from the poorest families. Poor pupils in the Netherlands are as good at maths as much better-off teenagers in France. The poorest 10% of pupils in Hong Kong scored at a higher level than the wealthiest in Sweden and Norway. The very lowest performers among this group were in the Slovak Republic. Mr Schleicher says it shows how academic differences attributed to social background should not be unquestioningly tolerated. \"We tend to overestimate the impact of poverty,\" he says . There was also a challenge to the idea that the UK has an unusually poor record on social mobility. Dr John Jerrim at the Institute of Education published a study suggesting that in international terms the UK was mid-ranking in the link between family background and future employment opportunities - 17th out of 34 developed countries. There was greater equity in Scandinavia and some European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands. But Dr Jerrim said social mobility in the UK was not dissimilar to France, Spain and Italy - and the UK's record was better than some central and eastern European countries. \"Policymakers often state that the relationship between family background and labour market earnings is stronger in the UK than most other countries,\" he said. \"It is not true that we stand out compared to the rest of world. Policymakers should avoid making such exaggerated claims when discussing this politically sensitive issue.\""

      "text": "The possibility of Brexit was one of the factors that led the US Federal Reserve to keep interest rates on hold, Chair Janet Yellen said. The US central bank also said it expected a \"slower path\" for future rate rises. It raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. On the 23 June UK referendum on whether to stay in the European Union, Ms Yellen said: \"Clearly this is a very important decision for the United Kingdom and for Europe. \"It is a decision that could have consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets. \"If it does so it could have consequences in turn for the US economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy,\" she added. Meanwhile, the US Treasury cleared all bond sales on the 23 June. Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, told Bloomberg Business that the Treasury alters its auctions calendar to avoid Fed monetary policy announcements, and that the UK referendum was a \"similar kind of market event\". Fed policymakers did not reveal when rates might rise, but the door has been left open for an increase when they next meet at the end of July. Chair Yellen added: \"Proceeding cautiously and raising our interest-rate target will allow us to verify that economic growth will return to a moderate pace, that the labor market will strengthen further, and that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2% objective.\" The Fed said in a statement that the pace of improvement in the labour market had slowed. The bank added, however, that \"economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labour market indicators will strengthen\" even with gradual rate increases. Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC News The key consideration in this decision was the US jobs market - with a little help from the uncertainties arising from the forthcoming British referendum and a few other factors. We have had two months where job creation has been disappointing, especially May. The Fed Chair Janet Yellen called it \"something of a loss of momentum\". But she also said signs there were signs that the labour market is \"approaching maximum employment\" and it's important not to attach too much importance to one data point. She - and, she said, the Fed's policy making committee - did not feel that \"progress in the labour market has come to an end\". Which leaves us (or at least me) having to pore over the next jobs report to see how likely a rate rise is in July. At this stage it doesn't look very likely, but it is not altogether off the table. The dollar fell against the euro and sterling, but Wall Street held on to earlier gains, with the S&P 500 up 0.3%. The Fed expected the unemployment rate to stand at 4.7% by the end of this year, before falling to 4.6% in 2017 and remain at that level in 2018. In May, US job creation fell to its lowest level in more than five years,"

Mr Holmes opened fire during the midnight premiere of a Batman film in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012. Officials say he was wearing body armour, threw smoke canisters and shot at people trying to escape. If the jury finds him not guilty on grounds of insanity, he will spend the rest of his life in a mental institution for the criminally insane. Otherwise he faces the death penalty. During opening statements on Monday, District Attorney George Brauchler said both mental health evaluators agreed on Mr Holmes' mental state at the time of the attack. \"Both of them said the same thing - that the guy was sane when he tried to murder all those people in the theatre,\" he said. Prosecutors have argued the attack was clearly premeditated, with Mr Holmes planning and amassing weapons for months, as well as elaborately booby-trapping his apartment to kill anyone who tried to enter. His parents wrote a letter to the Denver Post in December calling for his life to the spared. Robert and Arlene Holmes said their son was \"not a monster\", but suffers from severe mental illness. The trial comes after two and a half years of complicated legal questions related to the death penalty and the insanity plea, and after nearly three months of jury selection. The mental health evaluations could be a key factor. Judge Carlos Samour ordered a second mental health exam after prosecutors said the first one was biased. Defence lawyers objected to a second test. At the time of the shooting, Mr Holmes was a graduate student in neuroscience at the University of Colorado in Denver, but was withdrawing from his studies after failing a key exam. When he was arrested, Mr Holmes' hair had been dyed red in an apparent reference to the Joker, a Batman villain. He appeared dazed in his first court appearance, and cameras were banned from further hearings."

It is now returning what remains of the original $20m (\u00c2\u00a313m) donation. Mr Cosby denies any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crime. The Cosby family donated the money to the women's college in 1988 and the endowed professorship was established in the name of Mr Cosby and his wife, Camille. Mr Cosby, 78, is facing a series of historic sexual assault allegations dating back several decades. Recently released court documents from a 2005 civil case show he had admitted obtaining sedatives to give to women before sex. But Mr Cosby's lawyers said he was only one of many people who introduced the sedatives - Quaaludes - into their \"consensual sex life in the 1970s\". They said that at no point had Mr Cosby admitted to having any non-consensual sex or giving any women drugs without their knowledge. \"Quaaludes were a highly popular recreational drug in the 1970s, labelled in slang as 'disco biscuits', and known for their capacity to increase sexual arousal,\" a statement said. Mr Cosby's legal team is attempting to stop a judge unsealing the full set of documents from the case, including the confidential settlement agreement. More than 12 women have accused Mr Cosby of sexual assault, but he has denied all of the claims. 2002: Lachele Covington, a 20-year-old actress, reportedly files a police report saying she had been inappropriately touched. No further action was taken. 2005: Andrea Constand sues Mr Cosby for sexual assault. The case is eventually settled out of court in 2006. 2014: Over the year, dozens of women make public accusations that Mr Cosby sexually assaulted them. Live shows are cancelled across the country amid protests November 2014: TV network NBC scraps plans for a new show with the comedian following allegations by TV presenter Janice Dickinson that he had assaulted her in 1982. Repeats of the Cosby Show are also pulled from cable TV December 2014: Judy Huth sues Mr Cosby for molesting her in 1974 when she was 15 years old. Mr Cosby counter-sues, claiming she is trying to extort money from him May 2015: Mr Cosby speaks publicly about the allegations for the first time. \"I can't speak; I just don't want to argue; I don't talk about it,\" he told ABC News. July 2015: Court papers made public from Constand's 2005 civil case reveal Mr Cosby admitted obtaining sedatives with the intent of giving them to women he wanted to have sex with."

The deal depends on Aermont, which runs property investment funds, securing financing in the next four weeks. Pinewood's 007 stage is one of the world's largest and was used to film parts of Spectre and Skyfall. Some of Star Wars: The Force Awakens was also filmed at Pinewood in Buckinghamshire. However, Harrison Ford, the actor who plays Han Solo, was injured when the door of the Millennium Falcon closed on him and broke his leg. Goodweather Investment Management, which is owned by property investors Peel Holdings, and Warren James Holdings, owner of the eponymous jewellery chain, together control 65% of Pinewood Group and have agreed to the cash sale providing the buyer secures financing. The prospective new owner intends to keep the existing management in place, led by chief executive Ivan Dunleavy. The company has film and TV studios all over the world including in the US, Canada, Malaysia and the Dominican Republic. Earlier this year, Pinewood Group retained investment bank Rothschild to examine its strategic options. In the past, it had been constrained from raising additional funding for investment via the stock exchange. Shares in Pinewood were down 4.8% at 552.1p in afternoon trading."

As a result, it says it will offer five times more sustainable chocolate in the UK by 2019. But critics warn this could confuse consumers. They also fear that shared standards around ethical trade will be lost if more firms drop Fairtrade. So what prompted Mondelez's change of approach, and does it leave the future of the Fairtrade mark in doubt? Broadly, Fairtrade works as a voluntary certification system which holds adherents to strict standards - in particular paying a minimum price for raw materials such as cocoa, sugar and coffee. But Glenn Caton, northern Europe president at Mondelez, tells the BBC that while his firm and Fairtrade have the same goals, \"sustainability is about much more to us than price\". \"The next generation of farmers aren't taking on cocoa farming like they used to because it is so unprofitable, so we have to make sure their communities thrive and this means investing more in their communities,\" he says. As such, Mondelez wants to lead its own sustainability efforts - investing more in areas such as its supply chain, bonuses for farmers, training and climate change prevention. The Fairtrade Foundation has welcomed the move, too, which it says will leave farmers in developing countries like Ghana at least as well off, if not better-off. \"The relationship is not ending, it's changing,\" says policy and public affairs director Barbara Crowther, pointing out that the Fairtrade Foundation will remain a partner to Cocoa Life - independently assessing its progress and reporting its findings. The big question now is whether other firms will also choose to abandon Fairtrade certification and adopt their own systems of self-regulation. Certainly criticism of the Fairtrade system is mounting in the cocoa industry, says Dr Steve Davies of the Institute of Economic Affairs. The big issue is that most cocoa producers are small farmers who can't achieve the economies of scale of bigger farms, and that leaves many vulnerable to risks like drought and struggling to survive. \"Fairtrade does bring benefits to some producers, but it will not be a way of transforming the world trade system as some people seem to see it,\" he says. \"The only way to improve conditions for people working at bottom of the supply chain - those farming raw materials like cocoa - is by investing in the supply chain. Price floors might help but will only go so far.\" Another issue, says Tobias Webb, of supply chain consultancy the Innovation Forum, is that firms can find the web of overlapping ethical trade certifications out there complex to manage. These include not just Fairtrade's, but the Rainforest Alliance - which is dedicated to the conservation of tropical forests - and UTZ, the world's most prevalent label for sustainable farming. \"Producers can end up putting four or five labels on their products, and achieving each one requires a costly and time consuming audit. \"So many businesses like Mondelez are now moving towards in-house systems where"

In the end, the list of those wanting to pay respect Castro in person appears to be very short, with some notable allies choosing to send representatives instead. So who is making the trip to Havana? Perhaps most surprisingly, considering the two countries' long friendship, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will not be attending. His spokesman said he was too busy to travel to Cuba but that Russia would be sending a representative. Less surprising is US President Barack Obama's decision to stay away. Despite the steps Mr Obama made towards fixing US-Cuban relations, Castro remains a divisive figure - not least for Cuban-Americans who fled his rule. The White House will not send an official delegation, but Mr Obama's pick for ambassador to Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, and deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, will attend the commemorative event. UK Prime Minister Theresa May, France's President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are all staying away. However, they will be sending government representatives. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry will attend to represent the UK's Labour Party. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - whose late father Pierre was friends with Mr Castro - was one of the few Western leaders to release a message of condolences following the leader's death, but will not be attending. Governor-General David Johnston was attending Tuesday's commemoration. China's President Xi Jinping paid his respects at the Cuban embassy in Beijing, saying the country had lost a \"close comrade and real friend\". Vice President Li Yuanchao is representing China at the commemorations in Cuba. Despite their close friendship, Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang will also not be attending, sending National Assembly chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Nga in his place. The country will be holding a national day of mourning for Castro, however. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who paid tribute to an \"iconic\" world leader last week - will be sending his home minister but will not be flying to Cuba himself. North Korea's Kim Jung-un will not be travelling to Cuba either, sending a delegation on his behalf. The list of world leaders actually attending is relatively short. A number of South American leaders will be making the trip: Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, whose late mentor Hugo Chavez had a special bond with Castro, Ecuador's Rafael Correa, Bolivia's Evo Morales and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega have all indicated they will attend. Also expected are Salvadorean President Salvador Sanchez Ceren and Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto. At least two southern African presidents will also fly to Cuba, South Africa's Jacob Zuma, who has just survived a vote of confidence, and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, whose country has just brought in a new currency. And it seems the European Union may be represented by just one leader, in the form of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Other notable Europeans attending include Ireland's Gerry Adams and Spain's ex-King Juan Carlos."

The other exceptions are North Korea, Syria and Crimea, where it is banned from operating by US law. The announcement was made by the firm's chief executive Reed Hastings at his keynote speech at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. He also confirmed that Netflix would begin offering HDR (high dynamic range) content later this year. The company's shares closed the day more than 9% higher. \"We were expecting Netflix to go everywhere, but this has happened more quickly than we thought,\" commented Fernando Elizalde from the tech consultancy Gartner. \"Until now, the firm had been doing it in phased stages because of the costs of marketing and dubbing or subtitling the content. \"But it's worth remembering that in some of the emerging economies it will only be people in urban areas that will be able to use it because of limited internet availability.\" Mr Hastings said Netflix was in talks with the Chinese government, but acknowledged it would take time to reach an agreement. \"It's a very large country, you know a billion Chinese that we want to give access to the Netflix content,\" he said. \"In China you need specific permission from the government to operate, so we are continuing to work on that and we are very patient.\" But one company watcher had doubts. \"China is going to be a tough nut to crack given that that three strong domestic services already exist,\" said Mike Goodman from Strategy Analytics. As part of its expansion, Netflix has added support for Korean, Chinese and Arabic to its list of supported languages. That brings the total number - in which the firm provides subtitles, captions and alternative audio - to 21 languages. Mr Hastings added that Netflix would initially focus on expanding the reach of its existing content rather than commissioning extra locally-made shows. For consumers who already have Netflix, the biggest change may be the addition of HDR. High dynamic range video allows compatible TVs to show millions more colours and a wider dynamic range - added shades of brightness in between black and white - letting more detail be shown. Many experts believe the impact is greater than that of just jumping from 1080p to 4K ultra-high definition resolution alone. One consequence of using the format, however, is that it requires more data, and few TVs support it yet. Mr Hastings said users with compatible TVs should get a \"visceral sensation that's pretty amazing\". The firm's rival, Amazon, began streaming a limited number of shows in the format in 2015. Audience members at the Las Vegas event were also given a first look at some of the service's forthcoming shows, including: Ironically, the clips were blocked for those watching a live stream of the event.

He faced smuggling charges but was found guilty of a lesser charge of 'endangering life' because he hid the girl in an unsafe way in a van. Lawrie will have to pay the 1,000-euro (\u00c2\u00a3754) fine if convicted of another offence. The decision was met with applause from supporters in the courtroom. The former carpet cleaner, who disclosed he had bipolar disorder and Tourette's Syndrome, said he acted \"stupidly\". Before the case started he appeared with the child on his lap at a media conference in the French town. Lawrie said he feared \"being made an example of\" by the court. He told the assembled media: \"They see the media attention I have been getting and I think it could go one of two ways. \"France has an opportunity to show, as I know they are, a compassionate country.\" Lawrie said he regretted his actions and would not repeat the effort. He told the court he had acted stupidly and irrationally in hiding Bru in the sleeping compartment. Speaking via an interpreter, he told the judge: \"I saw the little girl and her father in the work that I was doing. That night I just could not leave her there any more. \"It was wrong. It was the most stupid conceived plan.\" Lawrie rejected the idea that he was trafficking for money, telling the judge: \"Her father is a farmer from Afghanistan. He doesn't have any money whatsoever.\" The aid worker was stopped in Calais as he returned home in October 2015. The former Army physical training instructor said he was helping build shelters in The Jungle camp when he got to know Bru and her father asked him to help get her to close family members living legally in Leeds. He said he was not a hero but \"an unemployed carpet cleaner from Leeds\" who wanted to help and had never been in trouble before. He told reporters his actions had left him penniless and on the edge of bankruptcy after giving up to \u00c2\u00a38,000 of his own money as well as collecting donations for the refugees. He was caught when British sniffer dogs found two Eritrean men who, unbeknown to him, had also stowed in the back of his van. Speaking outside the courtroom, Lawrie said that he had had a heavy weight on his shoulders but now felt \"light\" and would continue fighting to get help for child refugees in The Jungle. He said: \"I'm going to have a few days off and then I'm going to raise the profile (of refugees) even more because we cannot simply leave these children. \"We need to get these children now and into our education system because these guys are going to be doctors and lawyers and teachers if we get them now and educate them correctly. \"Or we can leave them in The Jungle to rot and die of cold.\""

At a meeting of the Association of Chief Police Officers in January, it was announced that 37 out of 44 forces had signed up to the new system. Critics say the rules are a money-making exercise and allow law breaking. Previously, only those travelling at up to 10% above the limit plus 6mph could be offered one of the courses. But the amendments were agreed by chief constables at a meeting of the Association of Chief Police Officers in January. For a 30mph zone, the upper limit for a speeding course would be 42mph. This would rise to 86mph for motorways and other major roads, although the official limit remains the same. Acpo said the figure at which a course could be offered was a decision for individual forces, and not all would make it available for higher speeds. Drivers can only attend one speed awareness course, costing between \u00c2\u00a360 and \u00c2\u00a3100, in a three-year period. \"There is evidence to show that if people are sent on educational courses, rather than being punished with a fine and penalty points on their driving licence, they are less likely to reoffend in the future,\" an Acpo spokeswoman said. \"Clearly if someone is breaking the speed limit outside a school when the children are coming out at 3.15pm, it's a no brainer and they would be punished. But if it is 3am and there's no-one on the streets, there is a degree of discretion.\" But Joel Hickman, spokesman for road safety charity Brake, said the new proposals \"sent out the wrong message\" and were \"simply a way of making money\" - a charge denied by Road Safety Minister Mike Penning. \"Many people drive for work and would rather pay \u00c2\u00a3100 to go on a course than accumulate points and risk losing their licence, so it is quite clear which is the greater deterrent to speeding,\" said Mr Hickman. \"It sends out a message that it's ok to speed, which it certainly is not. Speeding causes tragedy every day on British roads and results in a huge number of people being killed and seriously injured. It's also a factor in a quarter of all crashes. \"If you hit a child at 30mph, it's the equivalent of that child falling out of a three storey building. Driving at 42mph would mean that child having no chance of survival.\" But Mr Penning insisted road safety is the government's \"top priority\". \"We support the targeted use of educational courses where these are shown to have a positive effect,\" he said. \"The police are responsible for the administration of these courses but we are clear that course fees should not be used to raise revenue.\" 'Get-out-of-jail-free card?' The Institute of Advanced Motorists said it supported \"the widening of the bandwidths that allow drivers to choose a speed awareness course over a fine\". \"We don't feel it gives a 'get-out-of-jail-free card' - drivers can only attend one speed"

Uber has been under fire over its treatment of women staff since a former employee wrote a scathing blog post about her experience. It led to two investigations and the uncovering of 215 complaints about harassment and other allegations. Uber has struggled with a series of controversies in recent months, including a backlash over aggressive corporate tactics and a lawsuit from Google-owner Alphabet over allegedly stolen technology for self-driving cars. Several high-placed executives resigned amid the turbulence, including a former head of engineering, who had failed to disclose harassment complaints at his former employer. Chief executive Travis Kalanick's filmed argument with an Uber driver over falling rates also fuelled criticism, leading him to say that he needed \"leadership help\". Susan Fowler, who wrote the critical blog post about Uber, said the company had ignored her complaints of sexual harassment. Widely shared, the blog prompted Mr Kalanick to launch the investigations. Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem? Uber's mess reaches beyond sexism - and Silicon Valley Law firm Perkins Coie reviewed 215 claims, which included sexual harassment and discrimination as well as other complaints, an Uber spokeswoman said. The firm recommended no action in 100 of them; 57 remain under review, while others have received warnings or are in training, she said. Some of those fired held senior positions, she said. Discrimination, 54; Sexual harassment, 47; Unprofessional behaviour, 45; Bullying, 33; Other harassment, 19; Retaliation, 13; Physical security 3; Wrongful dismissal 1. Staff fired, 20; Staff put in training, 31; Final warnings, 7; Claims still under review, 57. Uber has also appointed Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under former US president Barack Obama, to investigate the company's broader culture. The findings of that report have been turned over to the board and recommendations are expected to be made public next week. Some changes are already in place. Uber announced the hiring of two women to high profile positions this week. Frances Frei, a Harvard Business School professor, will serve as a senior vice president for leadership and strategy, working with the head of human resources Liane Hornsey. Ms Hornsey is herself relatively new, starting at the company in January. Bozoma Saint John, a former marketing executive at Apple, is also joining Uber as chief brand officer. Uber employs more than 12,000 people globally. About 36% of the workforce is female, according to a diversity report the firm published earlier this year. Women hold about 15% of the technology positions. It goes without saying that this issue doesn't go away with these firings. Uber has major questions still to answer - some of them will hopefully be addressed when more details of the report are made public. Most troubling is why Uber's own internal HR measures weren't thorough or fair enough to see that the actions of 20 employees warranted dismissal. Instead it took a brave former employee - and then an expensive, lengthy investigation - to get to that point. So as well"

      "text": "You might forgive Laura Trott and Jason Kenny for leaving Rio rather full of themselves. Five competitions between them, five golds won. As of Tuesday night, had the couple been a country they would have sat 13th on the medal table, above Jamaica, Kenya and Brazil. That would be to misunderstand what makes them tick. This is a couple who got engaged while on the sofa watching an episode of EastEnders. You might think too that it would get competitive around the breakfast table in the cottage they share just outside Knutsford in Cheshire. Kenny now has six Olympic golds from three Games, more than Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Bradley Wiggins. Trott has four, more than any other British woman, and from one fewer Olympics. That would be to misjudge their relationship. Cycling superstars on their own, together they can be almost ordinary, almost invisible. After the gold rush, after their tearful embrace in the Rio velodrome with the world watching on, that may be about to change. \"The difference in their characters is what makes it work for them,\" says Trott's father Adrian. \"Until he gets to know you, Jason is a little bit shy. He's quiet and understated. Laura is bubbly, chatty, just as you see in her interviews. \"If they were both like Jason, God only knows how they'd talk about anything. And God forbid having two Lauras in a household!\" The relationship between the two began in the build-up to London 2012, with Kenny about to come out of Chris Hoy's muscled shadow at his second Olympics and Trott about to experience her first. \"I remember seeing Laura at the velodrome years ago,\" says Kenny's mother Lorraine. \"I said to my husband, 'Flipping heck, you need to watch this young lady.' She was in the elimination race, only a tiny thing, and she kept sprinting over the top of everyone. She was amazing. \"The first time I knew something was happening between the two of them was when Jason phoned me up and said, 'I'm bringing Trotty home for a bacon butty.' \"I said to him, 'Is she your girlfriend?' 'No, she's just a friend.' \"She made herself at home straight away. Into the house, sat down, feet up on the sofa. \"We liked her from the off. She's a girly girl, so I can talk make-up and clothes to her. It's such a treat - having had two sons, I've had years of remote-control cars and standing out in the rain, and at last I can talk to someone about posh shoes.\" Trott and Kenny are not the first couple to both win Olympic golds. Some (Steffi Graf, ladies' singles 1988, Andre Agassi, men's singles 1996) have carried more global renown. Others have also won gold in the same sport at the same Games, most recently triathletes Jan Frodeno and Emma Snowsill at Beijing in 2008. But no-one at a summer Games has more. No-one else gets even close. Neither has the British duo finished. Trott is 24, Kenny 28. The next Olympics in Tokyo are"

      "text": "But the message may take some time to reach India. The country had a lone shining moment with Girisha Hosanagara Nagarajegowda's silver medal in Men's High Jump F42 class for athletes with an impairment that affects their arms or legs. And deservedly the nation cherished Girisha's feat as medals have generally eluded India's Paralympians. But now questions are being raised at the country's ability to translate the congratulatory tone into awareness of disabled rights. India is not known for being friendly towards the disabled and most public places still lack basic facilities to help them in everyday life.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac 'Second-class' citizens Even before Girisha won his medal, Indian media was abuzz with stories about problems at the Athletes' Village. Several athletes complained that the Paralympics Committee of India had failed to book accommodation for escorts and coaches at the facility. This made the lives of the athletes very tough as they were denied precious time with their coaches. Taking to CNN-IBN, weightlifter Farman Basha said his preparation was severely affected because he could not move freely in the village without his escort. \"I was confident of a medal and now all my training has gone in vain,\" he said. The channel's editor, Rajdeep Sardesai, ran a special show to discuss whether India treats its Paralympians as second-class citizens. Many other channels and newspapers followed suit. It's an irony that the controversy received more coverage than the Games themselves. India may have won just one medal, but the Games were full of inspiring stories. The media seems to have clearly missed a chance to tell these stories to Indians in detail.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac Speaking on the CNN-IBN show, Olympic silver medallist Rajyawardhan Singh Rathod said he was not surprised with the treatment of India's Paralympians. He said much needs to be changed to give equal rights to Paralympians and millions of disabled people in India. \"It's an over-all attitude shift that we need to bring about in our country,\" he said. There is another thread to the story that the India media seems to have missed. The Indian contingent at the Paralympics did not have a single female athlete. While officials say this boils down to qualification woes, the problem runs much deeper. Most schools and colleges lack basic sporting facilities for the disabled and the ones which do rarely encourage disabled women to participate.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac While stories about the controversy continue to make headlines, nobody can take anything away from Girisha. The athlete certainly fought against the odds to make sure India did not return home from London empty handed. He hails from the south Indian state of Karnataka and belongs to an average middle class family. But his determination to win a medal set him apart from others. His training in Bangalore took place away from the glare of the media and fan recognition. With support from an NGO and government, Girisha quit his bank job six months ago to concentrate on training. Today the result is there for everyone to see. And he hopes that his achievement will transcend the boundaries of sporting achievement"

In one, the prime minister apologises to all homosexuals living in Uganda and gives his support to a gay pride march. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda and gay people have faced physical attacks and social rejection. Earlier this year, a controversial anti-gay bill, which proposes to increase the penalties for homosexual acts from 14 years in jail to life, was re-tabled in the Ugandan parliament. The bill was first introduced in 2009 but never debated - and the MP backing the legislation says a clause proposing the death penalty will be dropped. It originally said those found guilty of \"aggravated homosexuality\" - defined as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a \"serial offender\" - would face the death penalty. The Uganda Justice Law and Order Sector website was also reportedly taken over by hackers this week. Ambrose Ruyooka, commissioner for the Information Communications Technology ministry, told the BBC the problem had now been rectified. The government has created a directorate of security for all government websites and tightened cyber laws to counter rising cyber crime, he said. An activist named @DramaSett3r on Twitter is said to be behind the attacks. The operations were carried out by a group known as The Elite Society and the Anonymous hacktivist community, the activist said. On Wednesday, the official website of Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi quoted him as saying: \"We have got to expel the narrow mindedness from this country, and begin afresh, starting with a full and formal apology to all homosexuals living in Uganda today,\" screen grabs on Twitter and Facebook show. A message allegedly posted by the hackers on the prime minister's site on Tuesday said: \"Your violations of the rights of LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] people have disgusted us. \"All people have the right to live in dignity free from the repression of someone else's political and religious beliefs.\" The East African nation is a largely conservative society and many people condemn homosexuality both as unAfrican and unChristian. Western donors have recently said they could withdraw aid from those countries, including many in Africa, which do not recognise gay rights."

The researchers studied a group of hazel dormice in Denbighshire as part of the project. It found some dormice breed before they are one year old. The research also established that some produce two litters in a year, which was known behaviour in continental European mice but had never been observed in the UK before. The study is the longest and largest of its kind in the UK. Chester Zoo's biodiversity officer Sarah Bird said: \"Promiscuity in females had never been recorded before; and it will increase genetic diversity within litters, helping population survival. \"Equally important are the other breeding behaviours we have seen. \"It is likely that those years when females breed twice, and the young of the year also breed, is when populations can really increase. \"These behaviours are likely to be critical for healthy sustainable dormouse populations in the UK.\" Hazel dormice are protected under European law. The numbers of dormice and the range of the species have both been in decline since recording of the animals and their habitat began in 1990. However the Denbighshire site at Bontuchel, near Ruthin, showed a large, stable population of dormice. \"Our survey site in north Wales is on the very north western edge of their European range and, from the very start, we've been surprised by how many hazel dormice are there,\" Ms Bird explained. \"That's why it's a very important project and a very important site for study, to understand why this woodland is so good for dormice.\""

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a \"short sharp\" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people \"did not see the strengths\" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a \"je ne regrette rien\" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition. She has admitted the party failed to communicate"

The committee's vote clears the way for the bill to go to the upper house of parliament for final approval. The opposition says it will continue to try to delay the vote. The bill would allow Japan to defend its allies overseas even when it is not under attack. The bill is not widely supported by the country at large. Thousands of protesters rallied outside the parliament in Tokyo as the committee debate was under way. Opposition lawmakers tried to physically prevent the debate from taking place. In rare heated scenes, jostling members of the upper house surrounded the chairman of the security committee, Yoshitada Konoike, as he opened the debate on Wednesday and again on Thursday morning as the vote was taking place. The opposition had also tabled a no-confidence vote against Mr Konoike. Wednesday night's session was abandoned in the early hours of Thursday after opposition lawmakers blocked entry to a room where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other ministers were waiting to discuss the bill. The bill has already been approved by the government-dominated lower house. It is expected to be passed in the upper house because the ruling coalition has a majority there - this was why opponents were keen to prevent the committee from approving the legislation. It is thought Mr Abe's government wants to pass the bills before the country goes into a five-day holiday on Saturday, which could provide an opportunity for even bigger protests. If the upper house does not pass the bills within 60 days, they will have to be returned the lower house. It is a step Mr Abe is thought to be willing to take. His Liberal Democratic Party-led bloc has a two-thirds majority in the lower chamber, the House of Representatives. Despite his majorities in both houses, the controversial bills, and Mr Abe's determination to push them through despite vocal opposition, appear to have damaged his popularity. Polls have consistently shown a majority of the public are opposed to the changes, and relatively few strongly support them. Japan's post-World War Two constitution bars it from using force to resolve conflicts except in cases of self-defence. Mr Abe's government has pushed for security legislation that would allow Japan's military to mobilise overseas when these three conditions are met: What's behind Japan's military shift? The government says Japan needs to pass the bills, which are welcomed by the US, to ensure regional peace and security in the face of rising Chinese assertiveness. It also says they will allow the country to participate more widely in global peacekeeping missions. But opponents say the legislation violates Japan's post-war pacifist constitution, and could lead to it being dragged into US-led conflicts. Despite the likelihood of eventual defeat, opposition to the bills has been credited with helping reverse decades of youth disengagement from politics in Japan. Students in particular, have been closely involved in leading protests once dominated by trade unionists"

It comes after Theresa May suggested Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had not done enough to condemn abuse. The PM has called for parties to unite against \"bullying and harassment\". Since last month's general election, attention has focused on abuse suffered by MPs from across the political spectrum, including Tory Sheryll Murray who said she had faced social media comments like \"burn the witch\". On Saturday, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said some of her party's supporters had targeted female Conservative MPs - as well as Labour members - with \"vitriolic abuse\". But ahead of the Parliamentary debate, Labour has levelled accusations against the Tories in a letter to Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin from his Labour counterpart Ian Lavery and Cat Smith, shadow minister for voter engagement. \"Parties and politicians have a responsibility to set an example, by treating others with dignity and respect, including those with whom we strongly disagree,\" they wrote. \"The Conservative Party has instead promoted personal attacks as a core component of its national campaign. \"Abuse against candidates on social media is completely unacceptable. The Conservative Party perpetrated this on an industrial scale by spending millions of pounds to post highly personalised and nasty attack adverts on voters' Facebook timelines without their permission.\" They claimed Labour \"fought a positive, hopeful campaign\" and insisted that all its MPs ran campaigns based on its policies rather than personal attacks. On Monday, Mrs May - asked whether Mr Corbyn was doing enough in response to complaints of intimidation - said she was \"surprised at any party leader who's not willing to condemn that\". Conservative Simon Hart has secured Wednesday afternoon's Westminster Hall debate on \"the abuse and intimidation of candidates and the public in UK elections\". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics on Tuesday, Mr Hart said there had been a clear change in attitudes towards MPs and campaigners between the 2015 and 2017 general elections. People wanting to publicly support candidates were being \"driven away from politics at a time when we need them\" he said. \"This extends way beyond the so-called bullying of MPs, this is about online bullying generally,\" he said, claiming there had been a \"deafening silence\" from political leaders. Mr Hart claimed the emergence of Jeremy Corbyn-backing grassroots organisation Momentum had played a \"significant part\" in this shift. But Momentum dismissed his accusation as \"baseless\". \"If we are going to tackle the abuse MPs from across the political spectrum face, Simon Hart and other Conservative MPs should stop making baseless accusations for which they offer no proof, and instead think about how we can work together to find a solution,\" a spokesman for the group said."

The Royal party are due back in the UK on Friday evening, after a five-day tour that began in Poland on Monday. On the last day of the tour, the Duchess, who comes from a musical family and played the flute at school, took the musicians through the first notes of Beethoven's fifth symphony. The royal couple then listened to a performance of a symphony especially adapted for young people, and then went on stage to learn more about the orchestra. Earlier, Catherine and William walked around the stage accompanying six children trying out different instruments, including a violin, flute, timpani [kettle drums] and trombone. Later the Duke of Cambridge gave Prince George and Princess Charlotte a guided tour of a helicopter at the Airbus factory in Hamburg. Prince George tried on a pilot's helmet while Princess Charlotte played with buttons in the cockpit. The Duke flew helicopters when he was an air ambulance pilot. Antoine van Gent, head of flight testing at Airbus, said: \"The Duke was very relaxed showing his children the professional aircraft he uses. \"George was excited, with the first helicopter he wanted to sit in the cockpit and then he wanted to sit in the next one, he already knew there was a difference between them.\" Charlotte was less impressed after taking a tumble on the concrete after leaving the aircraft but Mr van Gent said she enjoyed playing in the pilot's seat."

Non-compliance with the pricing guidelines may have led to the termination of contracts, it found. Apple has not yet responded to a request for comment. At the time of the investigation, Apple denied that it controlled its products' pricing, telling Reuters that resellers \"set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world\". The regulator said Apple had now ended its price-fixing practices but has not said whether the company faces a fine. The FAS claimed that Apple Rus monitored the retail prices for the iPhone 5c, 5s, 6, 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus. \"In the case of the establishment of 'inappropriate' prices, the Russian subsidiary of Apple sent emails to resellers asking them to change,\" the watchdog said. The deputy head of the FAS, Andrey Tsarikovsky, added that \"Apple actively co-operated\" with the investigation and that the company had \"adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law\". That included training employees in the \"anti-monopoly legislation norms\" in Russia.

It was eventually handed to Donald Mackechnie, 66, at his home in Glasgow. The Bible had originally belonged to the great-grandfather of Mr Mackechnie's grandmother. Mr Whitehead, who was gifted the pocket-sized book in 2001 by an amateur Bible collector from Cleveland, Ohio, had rediscovered it when moving home in May. Noting that the Bible bore the name Alexander MacDonald of Inverness with the date 1 January, 1866, he decided to track down the descendants of Mr MacDonald, who was born in 1825 and worked as a ship master, wine merchant and grocer. After contacting Highland Council, he was put in touch with Anne Fraser, a historian at the Highland Archive Centre who created a MacDonald family tree. Mr Whitehead then used social media to track down Mr Mackechnie's daughter Mairi in Glasgow, who alerted her Islay-raised father. The Bible, which had a four-leaf clover tucked within its pages, was hand-delivered to Mr Mackechnie by Alistair Begg, a pastor at Mr Whitehead's church in Ohio who is originally from Glasgow and was visiting relatives in the city last month. Mr Mackechnie, clerk to the board at St Columba Gaelic Church of Scotland in Glasgow, said: \"There was a knock on the door one day and this chap was standing there. \"I almost fell on the floor when he explained what he was giving me. I could not believe it, it was such a shock and a surprise. \"The whole family are delighted and over the moon to receive his previously unheard of family heirloom. \"It does not even enter your head that this kind of thing could ever happen - it is quite amazing.\" Mr Mackechnie, a retired mechanical design draftsman, said the story of the Bible's return to Scotland is \"fascinating and shows there are still kind people in the world\". Mr Whitehead, who chose the book from a collection of more than 100, said he believes it is not a coincidence that it has been returned to the family of the original owner. \"I am very pleased that this keepsake treasure of the MacDonald family, located in Cleveland, Ohio, was safely returned to Mr MacDonald's native homeland,\" he said. \"It would not have happened if it had not been for the tireless effort of Anne Fraser and the kind gracious act of my senior pastor, Alistair Begg.\""

Mrs Logie had sustained head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene by the Scottish Ambulance Service. Her family paid tribute to the \"beloved mother, grandmother and friend\". They said Mrs Logie would be sadly missed, adding that she was \"born, bred and lived in the Leven area all her life\". \"The family are assisting the police in the investigation and wish to be left alone at this difficult time,\" they added. Detectives said there were no signs of a break in and so far no clear motive but they said Mrs Logie was murdered in \"a brutal\" way. Mrs Logie was said to be independent, capable and was an active member of the local church. She had spent the festive period with one of her sons in England, returning home in the new year. Police said Mrs Logie's neighbour had spoken to her in the morning. She told the neighbour she was going to the shops and then to the hospital to visit a friend. When the neighbour did not hear from Mrs Logie again he went to investigate and found her dead in her home. Det Ch Insp Keith Hardie, of Police Scotland, said: \"She had a brutal head injury. \"An 82-year-old woman in the safety of her own home being subjected to such a brutal attack is horrendous.\" \"Whoever has been responsible for causing Mary's death has preyed on a vulnerable and elderly member of the community and we are pursuing various lines of inquiry as part of this ongoing investigation. \"I would ask that anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious in the Green Gates area in the days and hours before Mary was found contacts police immediately. \"In addition, anyone with any other information that can help us find Mary's killer should also get in touch.\" Mrs Logan's local Church of Scotland minister said the whole community had been \"shocked\" and \"stunned\" by the murder. The Rev Gilbert Nisbet, of Leven Parish Church, said: \"Mary was part of the church community and very much involved in the life of the church. \"I have been the minister here for nine years and she came virtually every Sunday and I would chat to her at the door. \"Mary was friendly and outgoing, a kind lady who was bright and interesting to talk to. People are absolutely stunned.\""

      "text": "Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: \"It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. \"It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire."

      "text": "IS \"fired at everything that moved\" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says. Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled. IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS \"caliphate\", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria. \"According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,\" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory. He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey. He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer. The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes. The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings. Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms. In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children. Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town. Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added. Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months. Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes."

But many are put off - because a licence can cost ??1,000 - despite facing a fine of up to ??20,000, Southampton City Council said. The authority estimated a total of 1,500 unlicensed HMOs in the area. Shelter helpline adviser Nadeem Khan said fear of eviction and living in poorly maintained properties are frequent concerns raised by HMO tenants. \"Because of the huge shortage of affordable homes people are being forced into rented homes which are unregulated. We receive about five or six calls a day about this,\" he said. Nationally, mandatory licensing for HMOs is aimed at houses of three storeys or more and occupied by five or more unrelated people. In Southampton, the licences affect properties in Bargate, Bevois, Portswood, Swaythling (Designation 1 - introduced in 2013) and in Shirley Freemantle, Millbrook, and Bassett (Designation 2 - introduced in 2015). A council spokesman said: \"Landlords have generally co-operated with the regime, but a small minority have resisted applying for their licence.\" The council said it had so far gained prosecutions against one firm and 13 individuals."

      "text": "But on Monday the Church of England broke a tradition inherited from the first Christians 2,000 years ago when the three houses of the General Synod voted to allow women to be bishops. Since the days of Jesus and his 12 male apostles the Church has had exclusively male leaders - bishops whose authority has been handed down the generations by the laying on of hands. Hilary Cotton chairs Women and the Church, which campaigns for women bishops. \"Saying yes to women bishops is a cosmic shift,\" she says. \"It changes our whole understanding of what God intended people to be, and even changes the Church's theology by recognising that men and women are equally chosen to lead it.\" A senior figure on the \"high church\" wing of the Anglicanism, Prebendary David Houlding, says creating women bishops represents \"a massive shift\" in the way the Church presented itself to the world. \"It's an unprecedented acceptance by the Church of the secular values of society\", he says. \"There was a lot of damage to the Church's reputation when the measure was defeated before. It's terrified of sending the wrong signal again.\" Samuel Margrave, who also opposes the legislation, told the Synod: \"This is a show for the media. It's the end of the Church as we know it.\" The Reverend Lindsay Southern, the Vicar of Catterick in North Yorkshire, who supports the proposals, said a single vote for woman bishops would have huge long-term effects. \"It might look like a small change in direction from the outside, but it's like a ship at sea - a change in course over time will lead us to a completely different place.\" Women now constitute a third of the 11,000 Anglican priests, several of whom have reached senior positions. The Church's 42 dioceses have given unanimous backing to the latest proposals. But to take such a profound step, each of the Synod's three houses - representing bishops, clergy and lay people - needed to support legislation to create women bishops by a majority of two-thirds. The legislation failed in November 2012 because lay synod members who supported women bishops nevertheless believed that traditionalists were not getting sufficient exemptions from serving under them. The latest proposals would allow traditionalist parishes to ask a woman bishop for a male alternative, and take any dispute over the process to an independent ombudsman. \"There will be an 'expectation' that bishops will do their best to accommodate (traditionalist) parishes,\" says Prebendary Rod Thomas, the leader of the conservative evangelical group, Reform. \"But in the end it depends on trust, and that is the big question. Will there be trust?\" Evangelical traditionalists oppose women bishops because of their belief that the Bible calls for men to head churches. Traditionalists on the Catholic, or High Church, wing of Anglicanism believe that because Jesus chose only men to make up his 12 apostles, only men should lead the Church. In fact some do not believe that women can be priests, so that were a woman bishop to ordain a man as a priest, he"

Simpson shot 68 to set the target at one over and watched as 2010 champion McDowell missed a 25ft putt to force a play-off on the 18th. Lee Westwood took 73 for five over, while Tiger Woods (73) was seven over. Clubhouse scores in full Simpson, who climbs to fifth in the world, becomes the 15th different major winner in a row, the ninth straight first-time winner and the third consecutive American to win one of golf's grand slam events. \"I've never felt nerves like I felt today,\" said Simpson, who was pipped to the US money list title by England's Luke Donald last year. \"I had to hit my legs because I couldn't feel them. \"I probably prayed more the last three holes than I ever did in my life.\" Starting the final day four shots behind co-leaders McDowell and Jim Furyk, Simpson made his move with a spell of four birdies in five holes from the sixth. Parring his way home, he bettered the clubhouse mark of first-round leader Thompson, who shot 67, and took the outright lead when Furyk, who had been in front all day and led by two at one stage, bogeyed 16. Both 2003 champion Furyk and McDowell had a chance to force an 18-hole play-off on Monday, but the 42-year-old American finished with another bogey via the left bunker on 18 for a 74 to end two back and McDowell could only make par for a 73. \"It was grind and a slog, but I'll be back,\" said the 32-year-old McDowell, who had hoped to make it three Northern Irish wins in a row following Rory McIlroy's success last June. \"There's a mixture of emotions inside me right now, disappointment, deflation, pride but mostly just frustration.\" Furyk, whose hooked drive on the par-five 16th sparked his downfall, said: \"I don't know how to put that one into words, but I had my opportunities and my chances and it was right there. \"On that back nine, it was my tournament to win. I've only got myself to blame.\" Ireland's Padraig Harrington put up a serious challenge for a fourth major title and first since 2008 with a run of five birdies in 11 holes. But needing a birdie at the last to join Thompson, he ran up a bogey five after finding sand with his approach and ended with a 68 to finish three over. Americans David Toms (68), John Peterson (70) and Jason Dufner (70) also finished three over with 1994 and 1997 US Open winner Ernie Els on four over. The South African, who was third to McDowell at Pebble Beach, was one stroke off the lead after 15 but bogeyed the 16th and 18th for a 72. We shouldn't be too surprised at Simpson's victory. Twice a winner of big tournaments on the PGA Tour last year he is part of the wave of younger American players which shows that"

Powers to change speed limits are to be handed to the Welsh Government, although it is not clear exactly when. But road safety charity Brake said the proposals were \"disappointing\" and suggested a change would lead to more deaths on the roads. In 2015, UK ministers suggested limits could be raised in some areas of England and Wales. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: \"The M4 and A55 are vital arteries in the Welsh economy with thousands of commuters relying on their use every day. \"Welsh Conservatives believe that raising the speed limit from 70mph to 80mph [112km/h to 128km/h] could play a vital role in getting our economy moving and offering invaluable support to hard-pressed motorists, commuters and businesses. \"Consultation would be key - ensuring the views of all stakeholders are considered, so any change on the M4 and A55 is delivered with safety paramount.\" But Brake spokesman Jack Kushner said: \"We urge the government to reject needless proposals to increase speed limits to 80mph. We're disappointed it is being considered. \"Evidence from previous consultations made it clear that an increase would not only be dangerous - potentially 25 more deaths and 100 more serious injuries each year - but also highly damaging to the environment and economy.\" Political parties should focus instead on greater investment in \"sustainable\" travel and rural transport, he added. Plaid Cymru said the \"real priority\" for the two roads was tackling bottlenecks. Party transport spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"A Plaid Cymru government will press ahead with improvements across the A55 and will resolve the M4 problem around Newport with an effective and cost-efficient scheme that can be delivered quickly.\" Welsh Labour said Conservative UK ministers had \"ditched plans to raise speed limits because of the huge safety risks\". A spokesman said: \"It is ill-conceived and reckless, it will lead to increasing numbers of deaths and serious injuries on our roads while pushing up the cost of driving and making it harder to cut the emissions that contribute to climate change.\" A Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesman said: \"The Tories [at Westminster] first launched a consultation on this in 2011 and nothing has been heard since. \"We will therefore be taking this announcement with a pinch of salt.\""

They were one of only two sides to earn a point at Ibrox in the league last season, and Duffy insists they will make it \"as uncomfortable as possible\". \"[A Morton win] would be a monumental upset,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"Rangers are a different proposition at Ibrox. Even though they drew last weekend [1-1 v Ross County], their home form has been very good over the last couple of years under Mark Warburton. \"The pitch, the expanse at Ibrox certainly suits the style they play. But we will certainly go there with a bit more heart after last night [the win at Raith]. \"The heavy pitch took its toll so we have to make sure we recover right and prepare tactically as well. \"We will go there and try to make it as uncomfortable a day as we possibly can for Rangers. If we play well, manage to stifle Rangers a little bit and keep the ball, we can frustrate them.\" With last season's Championship winners Rangers 27 points behind Celtic in the Premiership, Duffy believes Warburton's side will place extra emphasis on Sunday's fifth-round tie. \"The nature of being a big club like Rangers is the expectations are huge,\" noted the former Dundee centre-back and manager. \"They know it is their only chance of silverware this season. Celtic have already got the League Cup, and have all but wrapped up the league, so the only trophy available to Rangers and their supporters is the Scottish Cup. \"That will be the main objective and target now which will make it doubly difficult for us because all their focus will be on that. \"But we have got a job to do - to stay in the game and be difficult to beat. If Rangers get a little bit nervous, and their fans get frustrated, then you never know. But we have to be good enough to take advantage of those situations.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Morton's victory at Stark's Park lifted them to within two points of second-placed Dundee United and nine off Championship leaders Hibernian, but crucially, nine points clear of fifth-placed Queen of the South in the battle for a play-off place. Duffy believes a prospect of a tilt at the title is unrealistic, insisting a play-off spot will be a significant achievement for the Greenock outfit. \"If we get into the play-offs, we will be singing and dancing, there is no doubt about that,\" he added. \"But it is still a long way away. A lot of clubs will be challenging for that. There will be clubs that can find a run of form and you can have a dip. \"But the players showed terrific character to bounce back from a disappointing weekend [losing to Queen of the South] and it sets us up nicely for the Scottish Cup tie against Rangers.\""

The 14-year-old has only drunk from the double-handled vessels, which are no longer produced, since the age of two. Tommee Tippee said it will produce 500 cups after it searched factories worldwide and found the original mould. The firm's attention was drawn to the family's plight when Mr Carter launched the Twitter appeal to find a replacement. More on a dad's desperate search for a cup, and other stories His original plea prompted offers of help from as far away as Australia. Mr Carter, 42, said the response from well-wishers had been \"incredible\" and it was a \"huge surprise\" to be contacted by the manufacturer. Mr Carter said: \"For me it's massive. Some people think I'm exaggerating but without it he doesn't drink so personally I'm very relieved.\" Tommee Tippee will send the cups on demand for free to the Carter family. Mr Carter said: \"I would not be happier if I won the lottery. We've moved down to the middle of nowhere and don't want much. \"Just knowing he has got these cups gives us peace of mind.\" Northumberland-based Tommee Tippee does not normally keep the moulds but had been searching factories around the world in the hope of finding the original plans. A spokesman said: \"We are delighted to confirm that we are able to start production on a run of the original cup. \"This will ensure that Ben has a lifetime supply and that his family won't ever have to worry about finding another cup for Ben.\" Mr Carter, from Devon, told the BBC his son has had his current blue cup for three years, but it is now falling apart and may only last a few more weeks.

Jason Taylor, 21, of Westfield, Lostock Hall denied murder but was found guilty after a trial by jury. At Preston Court, he was ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years. Mr Wilson died as a result of catastrophic bleeding from a stab wound in his thigh, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. Sophie Lorimer from the CPS North West said the \"brutal attack\" in front of his ex-partner was \"purely motivated by jealousy\". \"He could not accept that the relationship with his ex-girlfriend was over,\" she said. Taylor's girlfriend said he bombarded her with text messages and phone calls which \"progressively became more and more abusive\". \"The final text he sent to her stated he was giving her one last chance before things turned sour. \"Minutes later he violently broke into her house where Adam Wilson was also present.\" Ms Lorimer said Taylor then stabbed Mr Wilson numerous times with a large knife which he had taken with him. Taylor carried out the \"frenzied\" knife attack \"fully aware\" there were two young children also present at the house, she said. He then fled and hid from police in a neighbouring garden, she added. Ms Lorimer said Taylor had shown \"no remorse\" throughout the case in which he claimed he was acting in self-defence. Det Ch Insp Neil Ashton of Lancashire Police said Taylor's actions were carried out \"in anger and jealousy\". He said: \"His actions were completely unprecedented and resulted in the needless and very sad loss of a young man's life.\""

College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to \"low student numbers rather than any other reason\". He said it would continue to focus on adult education. Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire. BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued. Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years. She said she was \"absolutely distraught\" it was being cut. She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with \"disadvantaged, disabled and mature students\". The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added. Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course. One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: \"[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them.\" Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for \"people who would traditionally be excluded from academia\" and gives \"access to truly excellent learning opportunities\". Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts. He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were \"relatively new\" considering the college's 116-year history. \"Our focus will continue to be on educating adults and I think what we're doing is just renewing our offer but doing it in a different way, fulfilling our mission in a different way, to perhaps how we've done it in the past,\" Mr Wilkes added. The college previously lost funding from the Skills Development Agency."

He was taken to hospital with a deep laceration to his shin and puncture wounds to his calf, but said he would not be put off playing golf. He told ABC News he would try not to hit balls into the water in future. Crocodiles are a common sight on the golf course, Australian media reported, and signs warn players of the dangers. Police Senior Sergeant James Coate told ABC that the 1.2m (4ft) saltwater crocodile had been in a waterway on the 11th hole Mr Lahiff, speaking from Cairns Hospital, said he had seen crocodiles there before and \"should have realised to be a bit more aware\". \"I didn't see the croc sunbaking just on the edge of the water. I walked past it and then it got me on the way back and as soon as it grabbed me it took off into the water.\" He manage to drive himself back to the club house to get help. The Australian newspaper reported that wildlife officers would try to remove the crocodile and relocate it to a crocodile farm or a zoo. But Mr Lahiff told ABC he wanted the croc to stay where it was. \"I think he got more of a fright than me. He's alright,\" he said. The Palmer Sea Reef golf course is owned by Australian billionaire and politician Clive Palmer. After the incident he tweeted that he wished the golfer a speedy recovery. He joked: \"Crocodile has been removed from all menus at Palmer properties following today's incident.\" Crocodiles are a common feature of Australia's tropical north and numbers have increased since being declared a protected species in 1971."

The Mental Health Network suspects the funding has been used to support other NHS services. NHS England says it can show where the money has been allocated. The additional funding was part of a \u00a31.25bn investment over five years announced by the chancellor in the Budget in March 2015. While campaigners expected \u00a3250m to be made available this year, the Department of Health said in August that only \u00a3143m would be spent, as providers did not have the capacity to spend any more. However, the body representing mental health trusts says it has seen little of even that reduced amount. How the \u00a3143m was allocated: Source: NHS England Stephen Dalton, chief executive of the mental health network which represents NHS providers, said: \"Providers of mental health services and most importantly children and families are struggling to see the difference. \"It doesn't seem to have turned into posts on the front line. We are not hearing any reports of any significant investment at a local level around children's services. Indeed, some services are still experiencing cuts in services.\" NHS England says it has provided \u00a375m to clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), but NHS providers fear some of the money has been siphoned off to pay for other services. Acknowledging that is a possibility, CCGs have told BBC News they want NHS England to ring-fence the money, specifically for children's mental health services. Dr Phil Moore, chairman of the NHS Clinical Commissioners Mental Health Commissioners Network, said: \"Despite our commitment to better mental healthcare for young people, it has to be acknowledged that CCGs are dealing with increasingly financially challenging times and a myriad of competing demands on budgets. \"This, combined with the fact that children and young people's mental healthcare is in desperate need of heavy investment having historically been treated as a 'Cinderella service', is why we believe this is a rare case where funding should be ring-fenced.\" Some trusts say they have seen additional funding - the South London and Maudsley, for instance, said they had received an additional \u00a31.8m from four separate CCGs. And several CCGs told us they were committed to spending the money on new services. But some children's mental health services are also being cut, especially those provided by councils. Dr Marc Bush, senior policy adviser at the charity Young Minds, said: \"Our expectation is that overall spending on children's mental health services this year may either be flat or fall slightly in real terms.\" Former care minister Norman Lamb, who helped secure the extra funding, said he was concerned about the lack of progress. \"Given the pressure on the whole system including local government, there is a real risk that funding intended for children's mental health ends up elsewhere or simply replaces other funding cuts. \"There is an absolute moral imperative to address the very serious underfunding of children's mental health. Failure to invest this money now would be unforgivable.\" An NHS England spokesman said: \"As a society we must make"

Pwrpas y ddeddfwriaeth yw cynnig mwy o gefnogaeth i bobl sy'n byw gyda'r cyflwr. Mae'r mesur yn anelu at gyflwyno strategaeth ar gyfer diwallu anghenion plant ac oedolion yng Nghymru, a sicrhau bod cynghorau a byrddau iechyd yn deall ac yn cymryd y camau angenrheidiol er mwyn i blant ac oedolion dderbyn y cymorth sydd ei angen arnynt. Bydd pleidlais ar y Ddeddf Awtistiaeth yng Nghymru yn mynd ger bron aelodau'r cynulliad ddydd Mercher. Mabwysiadodd Cymru strategaeth awtistiaeth yn 2008 ac yn ddiweddar cafodd y strategaeth ei diweddaru i gynnwys targed amser aros penodol. Yr argymhelliad yw na fydd yn rhaid i blant ag awtistiaeth aros mwy na 26 wythnos cyn cael yr apwyntiad arbenigol cyntaf. Mae'r cynllun presennol ond yn para tan 2020. \"Be mae fy mil i'n ei wneud,\" medd Paul Davies, \"yw sicrhau bod y gwasanaethau yma yn fwy parhaol ynghyd \u00e2 gosod sylfaen statudol i'r gwasanaethau.\" Er hynny, mae Steve Thomas, prif weithredwr Cymdeithas Llywodraeth Leol Cymru, wedi dweud wrth raglen Eye on Wales, BBC Radio Wales nad yw'n siwr bod angen deddfwriaeth o'r fath.

Yr oll dwi'n gofyn ar y funud yw bo fi'n cael amser bant i gyflwyno'r bil - bydd angen ymgynghori yn eang.\" Dywedodd Llywodraeth Cymru ei bod wedi ei hymrwymo i wella cefnogaeth i bobol gydag awtistiaeth wrth i \u00a313m gael ei wario ar Wasanaeth Awtistiaeth Integredig Cenedlaethol yn ystod y pedair blynedd nesaf.

It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost \u20ac30bn (\u00a324bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of \u20ac3.5bn (about \u00a32.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP \"will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands\". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision."

Some 20 courses have now been cancelled while authorities investigate. About 90 would-be students have been refunded. College director Haji Yunis told the BBC he was co-operating with inquiries. Secretly filmed footage had showed Mr Yunis laughing about the scam he presided over. He told the researcher that for \u00c2\u00a31,200 he would \"bring you in the back door\" and \"fast track\" him to a bodyguard qualification without any training. Mr Yunis told the researcher not to worry about the police. Fraudulent use of SIA cards in fact carries a maximum six-month prison sentence. Both the exam board whose certification was fraudulently obtained, Industry Qualifications (IQ), and the Security Industry Authority (SIA) are investigating the college. An audit is currently taking place, with the aim of ascertaining how many qualifications awarded at the college to enable security guards to become licensed by the SIA were bogus. Jobseekers must sit mandatory exams to get an SIA card. A statement placed on Ashley Commerce College's website by IQ read: \"Following the BBC broadcast, IQ has been working with the regulators Ofqual and the SIA to formulate a plan for identifying learners affected by the fraud. \"We do expect to find evidence that some learners have received their qualifications without having done their course or tests properly. These qualifications will be reviewed. \"We know that this will leave many learners who attended ACC worried about the authenticity of their qualifications and IQ is working hard to find out how many learners may be affected.\" The statement said every student who obtained an SIA licence through the college may be affected. The college has been operating since 2010. The statement added: \"Where we cannot guarantee that a qualification has not been affected by fraud, we are required to remove the qualification immediately and notify the Security Industry Authority.\" Mr Yunis would not say how many students' qualifications were now being reviewed. Keith Vaz MP, the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, called the fraud a \"major scandal\". A Home Office spokesman has said any criminal behaviour would be addressed."

      "text": "Uptown Funk, which topped the UK chart for seven weeks and the US chart for 14, originally had six songwriters. The five writers of The Gap Band's hit were added earlier this week, according to RCA documents seen by Billboard. It's said to have followed a claim from publisher Minder Music on their behalf. The much-publicised Blurred Lines court case in March saw a jury order the track's writers, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, to pay Marvin Gaye's estate $7.4m (\u00c2\u00a34.8m) in damages because of its similarities with Gaye's 1977 hit Got to Give It Up. Uptown Funk's original writers were listed as Ronson and Mars, plus co-producer Jeffrey Bhasker and Phillip Lawrence from Mars' production team The Smeezingtons. Nicholas Williams - aka rapper Trinidad James - and producer Devon Gallaspy also got a credit for the use of a sample of James' track All Gold Everything. They have now been joined by the five writers of The Gap Band's hit: band members Charlie, Robert and Ronnie Wilson and keyboardist Rudolph Taylor, plus producer Lonnie Simmons. Billboard said a lawyer for James's manager Danny Zook agreed the Blurred Lines case may have influenced the Uptown Funk writers' decision. \"Everyone is being a little more cautious. Nobody wants to be involved in a lawsuit,\" he told Billboard. It is believed the claim from Minder Music was filed with YouTube's content management system in February. Vick Bain, CEO of The British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA), told the BBC that original songwriters \"absolutely deserve proper credit\". \"However it does get very blurred when people take inspiration,\" said Ms Bain. \"We can understand why Ronson and Mars wanted to avoid a very expensive court case, but I'm sure they would not have given credit if they hadn't felt that would be the right thing to do.\" Ms Bain said BASCA hoped all songwriters could avoid expensive court cases in the future, with the Blurred Lines case setting a \"dangerous precedent\". \"One of our members, who is an expert musicologist, he looked at it and said, 'in this country they wouldn't have won',\" she continued - referring to the way the jury made its decision based on sheet music of Gaye's hit. Echoing the comments of Pharrell Williams after the verdict, she said: \"It sets a very sad and dangerous precedent, because all composers and all songwriters for hundreds of years have been influenced by everyone around them. So I really hope it doesn't stifle creativity.\" In January, Sam Smith agreed to pay Tom Petty songwriting royalties for his single Stay With Me, because of its similarities to Petty's 1989 track I Won't Back Down. A spokesman for Smith said the singer \"acknowledged the similarity\" but said the likeness was \"a complete coincidence\"."

However, it appealed against an attempt to access police documents. Judges dismissed the appeal and said it was hard to contemplate a more grave subject matter. Mr Flynn has said the PSNI did not fully examine claims of security force collusion with loyalists. A notorious UVF unit, based in Mount Vernon, north Belfast, is believed to be responsible for two attempts to murder Mr Flynn. A gunman tried to ambush him as he picked up a taxi fare, and a bomb was placed under his car. It is alleged the attacker was a police informer. The PSNI argued that it had already admitted liability in the case and that producing the documents would be irrelevant, costly and divert resources from other cases. However, judges at the appeal court said the full extent of police misconduct needed to be established before compensation for Mr Flynn can be decided. The judges said discovery of documents in the case has a long and tortuous history, and that the PSNI should provide the papers as quickly as possible. Mr Flynn's claim is linked to an investigation in 2007 by former police ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan. That report found that members of the RUC Special Branch had allowed UVF informers to act with impunity, and that the Mount Vernon gang may have been involved in up to 15 murders. Mr Flynn claimed Mrs O'Loan's successor, Al Hutchinson, did not adequately implement recommendations from the 2007 report to examine whether agents' handlers committed any crimes."

      "text": "Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - \"Hell, no\" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. \"She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. \"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' \"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. \"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me. \"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. \"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. \"Being famous"

Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said she had \"no doubt it was menacing\". Philipps, who called his comments \"satire\", faces a custodial sentence. He was found guilty of two counts of making malicious communications and acquitted of a third at Westminster Magistrates' Court. One of the counts related to a post regarding Ms Miller, published on Facebook on 7 November 2016, which said: \"\u00c2\u00a35,000 for the first person to 'accidentally' run over this bloody troublesome first generation immigrant.\" Philipps, of Knightsbridge, London, described her as a \"boat jumper\" and added: \"If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles.\" Ms Arbuthnot found this offence was racially aggravated. The court heard how Ms Miller, 52, said she felt \"violated\" by Philipps's \"shocking\" comments about her. Ms Miller led a successful legal challenge which, on 3 November, resulted in the government being told to consult Parliament before formally beginning the Brexit process. Philipps, who defended himself throughout the trial, said his posts had been simply reflecting how he and others felt following this ruling in the High Court. He told the court: \"My family motto is 'Love of Country is my motivation'.\" He said his comments were \"meant to be a form of satire, a literary technique, iterated in my personal style, which may not be to everyone's taste, but is understood and accepted by everyone who knows me\". Ms Arbuthnot, in a series of exchanges with the peer, asked Philipps: \"Boat jumper, how can I see that as anything other than a racial, ethnic aggravation?\" But Philipps denied the allegation that his posts were \"racially aggravated\" saying that describing Ms Miller as a \"boat jumper\" and that she should go back to the \"steaming jungle\" were \"statements of fact not a racist comment at all\". He added that he would not have made any serious threat \"on an account where I could easily be identified\". He added he had deleted the posts as soon as he realised that his closed circle of Facebook friends had been \"infiltrated\" and screen shots of the posts had been passed to Ms Miller. Delivering her verdict, Ms Arbuthnot said there was \"nothing private about a Facebook post\". The other post Philipps was convicted for was in response to a news article about an immigrant in Luton, who was involved in a row over housing. Philipps wrote: \"I will open the bidding. \u00c2\u00a32,000 in cash for the first person to carve Arnold Sube into pieces.\" Kate Mulholland, from the Crown Prosecution Service said: \"No-one should have these kind of menacing comments made to them or about them.\" Philipps will be sentenced later this week."

Then you'd go to the course and can't make a score. Everything is stacking up against him now. Physically, mentally and obviously competing.\" Woods was a vice-captain for the United States as they beat Europe to win the Ryder Cup earlier this month, but Faldo thought he looked like he was \"struggling just getting in and out of the golf buggie\". The Englishman added: \"Watching him walk, he just doesn't look supple to me. \"I know the stamina needed to play 72 holes. He may be able to hit balls on a range, but there's a rhythm to that. \"On a course, you get a five-minute gap between two shots.

      "text": "By studying cubes of sand in the lab, they showed that areas squeezed by vertical stress are protected from erosion, while others wash away. The process had proved difficult to study, because natural slabs of sandstone erode over millions of years. The key to the experiments, published in Nature Geoscience, was an unusual \"locked sand\" dug from a Czech quarry. The study's first author, Dr Jiri Bruthans from Charles University in Prague, said the results revealed the \"Michelangelo\" behind some of the world's most famous rocky landmarks. \"The stress field is the master sculptor - it tells the weather where to pick,\" he told BBC News. Erosion by wind and water, it seems, is merely the sharp instrument. The remarkable shapes are controlled by internal stresses and strains within the rock, applied by the pull of gravity. As well as showing they could predict the shapes with mathematical models of that stress field, Dr Bruthans and his team sandwiched small cubes of sand under various weights and submerged them in water. The sides of the cube started to fall away within minutes, leaving fewer and fewer grains of sand to bear the weight. As that process continued, eventually the pressure on the remaining column caused the grains to lock together and resist further erosion. When they added faults or other distortions to the cube, and shifted the direction of the pressure applied, the scientists were able to reproduce a gallery of the sort of shapes seen in natural sandstone landforms. They were only able to watch all this happen because of the strange, sticky quality of the sand they used. From the Strelec Quarry, in the north of the Czech Republic, the team collected samples of a sand with particular interlocking properties: \"Strelec locked sand\". It is so soft that for many years it was mined in the quarry using hoses - but when it dried out, explosives had to be used. For his experiments, Dr Bruthans used 10cm blocks of this locked sand that were dried out an oven. \"It was very clever to find this rock out of a quarry that would behave in an accelerated way, compared to those famous sandstone arches,\" commented Dr Simon Mudd, a lecturer in landscape dynamics at the University of Edinburgh, UK. \"They've really demonstrated convincingly that as you erode this material, it begins to concentrate stress,\" he told the BBC. To show that the principle also applies to regular sandstone, Dr Bruthans and his team also took small cubes of normal, \"cemented\" sandstone from the same quarry and attacked them with cycles of heat, cold and salt, to simulate natural erosion. In all cases, Dr Bruthans showed that it was pressure that determined the shapes left behind. \"You can control it completely,\" he said. \"You select the pillar direction, by choosing the points where you apply the compression.\" One experiment even showed that a block of the Strelec sand, placed straddling a small gap and left outside in the rain for 15 months, would naturally form an arch. All of these processes can"

But on Monday, DUP leader Arlene Foster said she had not been consulted over it and it appeared it would not go ahead. But Mr McGuinness has said he does not think \"anybody should have a veto on a good idea\". The Irish government government said it proposed the forum to enable groups to work on areas of mutual interest, such as trade, investment and health. The UK's decision to leave the EU dominated a meeting of the North South Ministerial Council on Monday attended by Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness. Mrs Foster said the forum was not on the agenda. Instead, she said existing cross-border bodies would be used to work out the implications on the island of Ireland of a UK withdrawal from the EU. On Tuesday, Mr McGuinness said indications from \"very senior civil servants within the [Irish] government\" were that Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny would go ahead with the plan. \"I spoke to the taoiseach before the meeting of the North South Ministerial Council - he wasn't putting it as an item on the agenda but he stated very clearly to me that he still believed that it would be a very useful thing to do,\" he said. \"I wouldn't be too exercised about the fact that there will be political elements who wouldn't be interested in attending. \"The DUP will undoubtedly through different methodologies have their say in relation to all of it.\" He said he believed the idea of a forum would \"get widespread support from most within the political process\". Government ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic drew up a list on Monday of priority areas they intend to work on to limit any potential damage of Brexit. Among the points was an agreement to conduct a \"full audit\" to \"identify the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies\" that the island could face. And the two finance ministers will \"consider the issue of securing\" further funding for regional development from the EU."

It said it would be prepared to replace the blue lias with Brecon grey slabs - which are used elsewhere in Dunster - if acceptable, but added it \"would not be cheap\".

Dunster was part of the Luttrell family estate until 1951, when it was sold. After the sale, Somerset County Council's highways department took responsibility for the roads but not the pavements. It previously said it would only adopt the pavement if a smooth surface was laid. The cobbles had fallen into a state of disrepair and people had been falling and injuring themselves. The Dunster Working Group wanted to re-lay them, but was worried about being sued if anyone fell.

The final squad before the autumn Tests will be named on 26 October, and with injuries to Wasps' James Haskell and Harlequins' Jack Clifford, England currently have a void at open-side flanker. Northampton's Teimana Harrison started there in England's last match - against Australia in Sydney as Jones' men wrapped up a series whitewash - and is set to be named in Friday's squad. But the Wasps' pair of Guy Thompson and Sam Jones have impressed so far this campaign. \"There has been a lot of talk about Guy with his form at the start of the season,\" added Young. \"And everyone knows what a big fan I am of Sam Jones - his work-rate is phenomenal.\" Hooker Tommy Taylor has been \"excellent\" according to Young, while Wasps number eight Nathan Hughes is likely to be involved having qualified on residency in the summer. Scrum-halves Joe Simpson and Dan Robson have also both stood out in partnership with fly-half Danny Cipriani. Meanwhile, Leicester flanker Will Evans has been touted as a possible solution to England's number seven conundrum. Evans starred for the Junior World Championship-winning Under-20s in the summer, and followed that by being named in an England training squad in August. It is understood Evans is set be named in the EPS on Friday, but his director of rugby at the Tigers, Richard Cockerill, says the 19-year-old should not yet be thrust into the international arena. \"Will is not ready to play international rugby,\" Cockerill told BBC Sport. \"The reality is he has started one game for Leicester, and before that he was playing for Ampthill in National One. \"Eddie sees him as a project player and is keen to get the transfer from 20s to the senior group - and his potential is huge. \"He is a great young player, who is going to be very, very good. But at the moment but he is not ready yet [for Test rugby].\" However, Cockerill feels differently about Mike Williams, the Zimbabwe-born Tigers forward, who is a firm part of Jones' plans, and could even make his England debut come November. \"Mike Williams has a little bit more experience,\" Cockerill said of the 24-year-old. \"Given the opportunity he is ready to step up to Test match level today.\""

The nation's 1.4 million active-duty uniformed military personnel remain on duty. However, about half of the defence department's 800,000 civilian employees stopped work at the beginning of the shutdown - with the exception of those engaged in activities that \"provide for the national security\". But on 5 October, the department said it would recall nearly all of these workers. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the decision was based on an interpretation of the Pay Our Military Act, which was passed by Congress shortly before the shutdown. It permits employees \"whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members\" to be exempted from the shutdown. \"I expect us to be able to significantly reduce - but not eliminate - civilian furloughs under this process,\" Mr Hagel said. (only if shutdown continues) The Department of Energy has said it can continue to operate for a short time without sending workers home. However, if the shutdown continues, plans are in place. According to the plans, some facilities will have to close, with only 1,113 out of 13,814 staff required to work. Exemptions include staff overseeing the safety of the nation's nuclear arsenal and operating dams and power lines across the country. The National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons and naval reactor programmes, will have 343 employees on duty to \"perform functions related to the safety of human life and the protection of property\". More than 400 employees will stay on to work at the Southwestern Power Administration and the Western Area Power Administration, which are in charge of overseeing hydroelectric power and power lines in the south and western US. Some staff in other areas will remain at work to oversee \"the protection of human life and property.\" Most of the department's staff have been sent home. However, staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration continue to report for duty to ensure weather, shipping and other reports are still provided for public safety. Some of the workers at the Bureau of Industry and Security, which reviews exports, also remain on duty. Transport roles run by the department, ranging from air traffic control to airport and hazardous materials inspections, continue and 36,987 out of 55,468 personnel remain at work. Staff involved in overseeing commercial space launches also continue operations. Suspended activities will include facility security inspections, routine personnel security background investigations and the employee drug testing program. The National Zoo and 19 museums and galleries, including the Natural History Museum, the Portrait Gallery and the Air and Space Museum, are closed. Of the 4,202 employees, 688 are being retained to \"protect life and property\" - security guards, maintenance staff and people to care for and feed the animals at the National Zoo. The Smithsonian Institution says: \"During a shutdown, the Institution cannot legally accept voluntary services from federal employees to continue their regular duties.\""

Campaigning group Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka says they are proof the boy was summarily executed. A military spokesman denied the allegations. He said they were based on \"lies, half-truths and rumours\". JDS says analysis of the photographs' metadata shows they were taken by the same camera at 10:14 and 12:01 on 19 May 2009 - on the final day of Sri Lankan forces' bitter 26-year war against the Tigers. Velupillai Prabhakaran died at around the same time in a stretch of land between the Nanthikadal lagoon and the sea, where hundreds of thousands of civilians were trapped in the last bloody months of the conflict. The army said he was killed in battle but human rights groups said he might have been killed after surrendering. British film-maker Callum Macrae says the photographs of Balachandran Prabhakaran - which show the young boy first alert and unharmed and in the custody of soldiers but then dead, shot five times in the chest - rules out the government's assertion that Balachandran was killed in crossfire. \"His death was deliberate and calculated. This is a proof, beyond reasonable doubt, of the execution of a child - not a battlefield death,\" said Mr Macrae. \"The pictures fill in chilling details on the circumstances of his murder - and leave the Sri Lankan government with yet more questions to answer.\" But army spokesman Ruwan Wanigasuriya said the photos showed \"no substantive evidence\", and were being released in Mr Macrae's latest documentary, No Fire Zone (NFZ), that is timed to coincide with a session of the UN Human Rights Council next month. In the past two years, Mr Macrae has made films for the British TV station, Channel 4, using video evidence to allege that the government side committed serious war crimes as it defeated the Tamil Tiger militants in 2009 - allegations always denied by Colombo. The new film is set to be screened at the Geneva Human Rights Film Festival during a UN Human Rights Council meeting next month. Meanwhile 133 Sri Lankan Christian clergy, mostly from the former war zone, have signed a letter urging the UN Human Rights Council to pass a strong resolution that is critical of Colombo and will set up an international inquiry into all alleged war crimes. The mainly Tamil churchmen and women say that today the ethnic minority's culture, religions, language and land are being suppressed with what they say is \"an intent to destroy us in whole or part\"."

It means virtually all of their profits are being handed over to councils, with some energy schemes now making a loss, BBC Wales has heard. The Welsh Government said it was aware and considering the case for specific assistance. The British Hydropower Association accused ministers of \"sitting on their hands\" while Community Energy Wales said it was \"ripping the guts\" out of projects. Community energy schemes are often small enterprises run by volunteers, designed to generate income for their area. But the way business rates are calculated means hydro schemes are hit hard: Business rates in England and Wales are calculated by an independent body - the Valuation Office Agency - but the Welsh Government is in charge of how they are raised here. The British Hydropower Association has written to Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford to ask for support. Chief executive Simon Hamlyn said: \"Community hydro schemes are suffering and those businesses will say we can't afford to pay these rates and they'll abandon these schemes and that's the last thing we want.\" Keith Jones, director of Community Energy Wales, said the average increase was 300%. \"No-one could foresee this coming, we didn't even put it down as a risk in our business plans that such a blunt instrument would be used to get more money out of us.\" Mr Jones said the Scottish government had extended a 100% business rates relief for community energy schemes while in England they were capping the increase at \u00a3600. Gavin Gatehouse helps run the Ynni Anafon hydro scheme in Abergwyngregyn, Gwynedd, which has seen its monthly rate rise from about \u00a3900 to more than \u00a32,000. It took five years to set up and could generate up to \u00a340,000 of disposable income per year for projects in the area. A charity has been formed so groups and individuals can apply for grants, but this increase means there will be less money to hand out. The community hydro at Bethesda is predicting it will now make a loss. \"It's very frustrating and I'm very angry about it,\" Mr Gatehouse said. \"We'll be seeing a huge proportion of our profit eaten away to substitute for lack of government provision of grants to local authorities.\" Mr Drakeford has said more than \u00a3210m of rate relief was being provided for 2017-18 to businesses including community energy projects. \"We are going to prepare a new scheme for rate relief for small business from 2018 onwards. I am happy, as part of this, to consider the case for specific assistance and support for some projects, including the community energy projects and community hydro projects.\" The Green Party said it would remove subsidies to fossil fuels and scrap \"regressive taxes\" on the community energy sector. Welsh Liberal Democrats pledged to review business rates exemptions and make a presumption in favour of renewable energy projects \"in or on suitable publicly owned buildings and land\". Plaid Cymru's shadow cabinet secretary for energy, Simon Thomas, said"

O'Sullivan won seven frames in a row to move 8-4 ahead before Perry, helped by breaks of 117 and 92, fought back. But O'Sullivan, 41, sealed victory to defend his title and move ahead of Stephen Hendry's six Masters wins. Victory means O'Sullivan claimed the newly named Paul Hunter trophy - in honour of the three-time champion who died of cancer aged 27 in 2006 - as well as the \u00a3200,000 winners' prize money. It also ensured the world number 13 ended a run of three defeats in finals this season and defended the title he won last year by thrashing Barry Hawkins 10-1. \"Joe played a brilliant tournament, a really good match and he should've beaten me. I got lucky - I stole it,\" said O'Sullivan. \"Joe will come again and he is a tough competitor. I'm just relieved to have got over the line. The fans have been unbelievable and I really enjoyed this week.\" On winning seven Masters title, O'Sullivan added: \"It is great to get some records, I still have the World Championship one to get. \"When I was younger I was just happy to win one, so to win seven, someone up there is looking after me.\" 'The Rocket' had to deal with a virus in his first-round final-frame victory over Liang Wenbo and needed to repair a broken cue tip in the semi-final against Marco Fu, which he said was the \"best match he has ever won\". In the final, O'Sullivan seemed unsettled by noise coming from a backstage table early on, but pulled himself together to level the match 4-4 at the interval. He claimed a 32-minute ninth frame to move into the lead for the first time, and then knocked in breaks of 85 and 68 to take control. At 8-6 and with Perry fighting back, O'Sullivan made his first century of the match - a break of 112 - and 859th of his career. The Englishman then held his nerve to win a 20-minute tactical frame and claim his 17th Triple Crown title. Along with seven Masters - the first of which he won in 1995 - he has also claimed five World and five UK Championship crowns, and is now just one behind Hendry's record of 18. Media playback is not supported on this device Perry has only won one ranking title - the 2015 Players Championship - but seemed to take to the occasion well, with breaks of 72, 74 and 115 giving him a surprise lead.

Fair play to Ronnie, even when he is not at his best he is still amazing Although he rallied by clawing back three frames late on, O'Sullivan's substantial advantage was too great to overturn. \"I've proved a lot,"

The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a \"direct result of the injuries\" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were \"devastated and beyond shock at what's happened\". \"Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well,\" said Mrs McAllister. \"We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters.\" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. \"This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,\" said Mrs McAllister. \"My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis.\" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt \"very angry\" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. \"We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,\" she added. A man appeared in court on Saturday charged in connection with the bomb attack on Mr Ismay. Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said it was \"yet another difficult day for the Ismay family, his friends and colleagues as they struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 days\". He added: \"We have spoken to the family this morning and advised them of this development. \"We are also liaising with the Public Prosecution Service in relation to the individual who is currently charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion with intent to endanger life.\" The PSNI have also repeated an appeal for information on two cars that police believe may have been used by the bombers - a red Citroen C3 and a silver Skoda Fabia."

The call came in at 12:42 EST (17:42 GMT) and firefighters were on the scene in less than four minutes, it said. The window cleaners were pulled inside at around 14:15 EST. The rescued men were identified as Juan Lopez, who has been a window cleaner for five years, and Juan Lizama, who has been on the job for 14 years, Gerard McEneaney, a labour union official, told Reuters. The 1,776ft (541m) tower opened for business last week as the first of 3,000 employees of publishing giant Conde Nast moved into their new offices there. A police official said the partially collapsed cradle was hanging at \"a 75-degree angle\". The cable on the cradle apparently broke as it retracted towards the roof of the building. People on the ground were moved back in case glass fell from One World Trade Center, the country's tallest skyscraper. Gary Hansen, an architect who worked on the building, happened to be across the street during the incident. Mr Hansen told Reuters the building was designed with three cranes on top, two to suspend platforms and one for emergencies. \"These are the kind of emergencies architects plan for,\" he said."

He was jailed for 56 months in the UK in 2011 for possessing indecent images of children. More on this and other news from Cambridgeshire Wilkins, who holds dual UK and US citizenship, was on probation when he left the UK on 31 January. He set up an online site enabling him to arrange to meet boys, but was caught in a sting operation in Palm Springs, California, by undercover Homeland Security Department special agents. He had paid one agent $250 (\u00c2\u00a3170) to have sex with a nine-year-old Mexican boy. Wilkins had initially denied four charges of travelling with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, attempted sex trafficking of children, transportation of child pornography and possession of child pornography, the US District Attorney's Office said. A trial date was set for November, however, at a hearing on Wednesday he pleaded guilty to transporting child pornography under a plea agreement with the US Attorney's Office. He agreed to a 13-year prison term and a lifetime of supervised release, the US Department of Homeland Security said. Wilkins also admitted in court to travelling to the US in order to have sex with two young brothers, paying to have sex with the nine-year-old, possessing pornography and bringing a computer into the US containing \"graphic images of boys ranging in age from five to eight\". US Attorney Eileen Decker, chief federal law enforcement officer in the Central District of California, described Wilkins as a \"predator\" and \"extremely dangerous\". The plea agreement meant he would \"be in prison for well over a decade,\" she said. As part of the agreement the three other counts are expected to be dismissed when Wilkins is sentenced for the transportation charge. Wilkins was detained as part of Homeland Security's Operation Predator, an international initiative to protect children from sexual predators."

He said he expected the volume of calls the helpline receives over the weekend to \"significantly increase\" as winter approaches, which indicates that the service \"would fall below acceptable tolerances\". \"This is not a decision that we have taken lightly, given the significant investment to date, but one that will ensure we can continue to deliver vital and safe out-of-hours support to patients when they need it most during the coming winter\", he said. The NHS will continue to develop the new system offline before rolling it out again early in the new year. Scottish Labour's public services spokeswoman Jackie Baillie accused the Scottish government of having a \"short-term, sticking plaster approach to the NHS\". Scottish Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw called the project \"a mismanaged shambles\" which had cost the taxpayer a fortune. Health Secretary Shona Robison said that while NHS 24 remained fully operational, she was disappointed that it had to revert to the previous system. However, she said patient safety was the priority and \"it is right that NHS 24 take the time necessary to understand and fix any outstanding problems completely\". Theresa Fyffe, Royal College of Nursing Scotland director, said it was \"regrettable\" but \"the right decision\" for patients and staff. The announcement follows an incident in October, when the same system crashed and staff had to resort to pen and paper. An Audit Scotland report had also previously raised concerns over the cost and delivery of the system. Initially due to be ready for October 2013, it was delayed for two years and cost about \u00a3117m - almost \u00a340m above the expected cost."

But Congress is deeply opposed to terror suspects being held on US soil and is expected to block the move. The prison costs $445m (\u00a3316m) to run annually and closing it was a 2009 promise from President Barack Obama. Human rights campaigners have repeatedly complained about the prison in Cuba, which has held 780 detainees since it opened in 2002. The president told reporters on Tuesday it undermined national security. \"This is about closing a chapter in our history,\" said Mr Obama. \"It reflects the lessons we've learned since 9/11 - lessons that must guide our nation going forward.\" But Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio was scathing in his criticism, saying Guantanamo prisoners do not belong on US soil. \"These are literally enemy combatants,\" he said, adding he would ship terrorists straight to Guantanamo \"to find out what they know\". Life after Guantanamo prison Will Guantanamo prison finally close? There are four main components in the White House plan: It estimates the move would save up to $180m (\u00a3128m) a year in cost savings. The president, who will complete his second and final term in January, said it was important not to pass the problem on to his successor. \"Keeping this facility open is contrary to our values. It undermines our standing in the world. It is viewed as a stain on our broader record of upholding the highest standards of rule of law.'' President Obama has tried for years to close Guantanamo. He and his deputies say that it hurts the reputation of the US and that militants use \"the infamous orange jumpsuit\", as one senior administration official described it, as a recruiting tool. But members of Congress have baulked at Mr Obama's plan to close the prison, saying they believe it should remain open - and they don't want any detainees to be transferred to the US. Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, for example, said the prisoners should \"stay right where they are\". Lately, though, White House officials said that lawmakers, or at least some of them, seem more receptive to the idea. A senior administration official told reporters that there's \"room for conversation\". That's important since Mr Obama has less than a year to close the prison - and for him time is of the essence. Guantanamo Bay is located on an American naval base in south eastern Cuba. Former US President George W Bush opened it to accommodate foreign terror suspects after the 9/11 attacks on the US. One of the key complaints from human rights groups is that many detainees have been held there without charge or trial. White House officials said they could not give any names of people being held, but the New York Times has its own list. The Obama plan does not specify where in the US detainees would go. But the Pentagon has considered 13 different locations in the US, including seven prisons in Colorado, South Carolina and Kansas, and six other places"

She campaigned against Communism and is credited with creating the political climate that helped Ronald Reagan become president. Mrs Schlafly publicly endorsed Donald Trump at a rally in March. Paying tribute to her on Monday, the Republican presidential candidate described Mrs Schlafly as \"a patriot, a champion for women and a symbol of strength\". Mrs Schlafly's death, in St Louis, was announced by the Eagle Forum, a conservative group she founded in 1972. It described her as an \"iconic American leader whose love for America was surpassed only by her love of God and her family\". Mrs Schlafly was a strong advocate of traditional family values and one of her crowning political victories was helping to stop the Equal Rights Amendment [ERA] from being added to the US Constitution. She once described feminists as \"a bunch of bitter women seeking a constitutional cure for their personal problems\". Donald T Critchlow, author of a biography of Phyllis Schlafly, said that defeating the ERA helped to usher in a new conservative era in US politics, paving the way for Ronald Reagan's election in 1980. The Eagle Forum said Mrs Schlafly was survived by her six children, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren."

Sinclair was convicted last year of raping and murdering Christine Eadie and Helen Scott in 1977. The teenagers disappeared after being in the World's End pub in Edinburgh's Royal Mile. Their naked bodies were later found in a field in East Lothian. Police believe Sinclair has also killed at least six other women and girls. The sentence given to Sinclair, who will turn 70 this year, means he would be aged 106 before he was eligible to apply for parole. His conviction brought one of Scotland's most infamous unsolved cases to a conclusion, and marked the first prosecution since changes to Scotland's double jeopardy law. Sinclair, a violent offender who has already spent more than half of his life in prison, had intended to appeal against the World's End conviction. But a procedural hearing at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh was told that he no longer intends to appeal against the conviction, a spokesman for the Judicial Office for Scotland confirmed. A formal abandonment is expected to be lodged in due course and his appeal against sentence will be heard in November."

It will be working on the 4 and 5 June and when the Olympic torch relay passes through the borough on 8 July. The fountain on Parkway in the town was built to celebrate the Queen's accession to the throne in 1952.

The council is buying water from a landscaping firm which already supplies water from a natural lake source, to maintain the borough's open spaces. It cannot be drunk so is permitted under the hosepipe ban regulations. Council chief executive, Michel Saminaden, said: \"They have told us that there is an abundance of water in this lake so we are probably doing them a favour by taking it.\" Mr Saminaden added that the council decided against asking the Veolia water company for a special dispensation. \"I thought that wasn't the right thing to do because we would be using precious water,\" he said. \"What we are doing now is using water that is surplus and we have been told categorically that there is no problem in using it. This is a better all round sustainable solution. \"I am extremely pleased that we have been able to find a solution which will enable everybody to see the fountain in all its glory on the occasion of these two great celebrations.\""

However, a raid into the town launched at dawn is reported to have been repelled by militants. The offensive, which began on Tuesday, is aimed at cutting a key route between IS-controlled areas in Syria and Iraq. The NSA said it was co-ordinating the assault with Iraqi government forces, who were advancing on the border from the other side. Several hundred rebels are reportedly involved in the attack on Albu Kamal, just a few kilometres from the Iraqi border in Deir al-Zour province. The NSA and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, both said on Wednesday morning that the rebels had taken control of Hamdan airport, about 5km (3 miles) north-west of the town. Fighting was continuing between the two sides in agricultural areas around the town, and coalition warplanes were conducting air strikes on IS hideouts in the town, according to the Syrian Observatory. NSA spokesman Mozahem al-Saloum told the Associated Press that airborne fighters had also been dropped onto the southern edge of Albu Kamal. Later on Wednesday, the NSA issued a statement saying its forces had \"conducted a deep penetration raid\" into Albu Kamal. \"At this time fighting is still ongoing, but the NSA maintains control of the desert, the approaches to Albu Kamal, and maintains freedom of manoeuvre,\" it added. The Reuters news agency cited two rebel sources as saying that the NSA had been forced to retreat to the outskirts after an IS counter-attack. One of the sources said militants had encircled the rebels in a surprise ambush. The rebels had incurred heavy casualties and lost some of their weapons, the source added. As the rebels advanced on Albu Kamal, IS released a video showing militants beheading five young men in the town who they claimed were working with the NSA, the Syrian Observatory said. The NSA was formed about 18 months ago by rebel factions driven out of eastern Syria by IS, which proclaimed the creation of a \"caliphate\" in June 2014. NSA fighters, who have been trained at US-run camps in Jordan, captured the Tanf border crossing between Syria and Iraq from IS earlier this year. IS is also facing pressure from a US-backed offensive in northern Syria by an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters, who have surrounded the town of Manbij and cut a route to the Turkish border from the IS stronghold of Raqqa. In a separate development on Wednesday, at least seven people were killed in a car bomb attack in the Kurdish-controlled northern town of Tal Abyad, near the Turkish border, state media reported."

Deputy Chief Constable Peter Hayes and Assistant Chief Constable Walter Jackson are connected to both cases. The officers, who were involved in a review of the evidence after Orgreave and have links to Hillsborough, have both denied any wrongdoing. Mr Metcalf did not wish to comment on Orgreave when approached by the BBC. About 10,000 strikers and 5,000 police officers clashed at Orgreave coking plant in June 1984. Mr Hayes ordered a review of the way evidence had been gathered about Orgreave and was later involved in co-ordinating the force's evidence after the disaster at the Sheffield stadium. Mr Jackson was given the job of reviewing the Orgreave evidence and was at Hillsborough to watch the FA Cup semi-final after signing off the policing plan. The parallels between Hillsborough and Orgreave have been drawn before. Now evidence is starting to emerge showing the actual links, the names of people involved in the aftermath of both. There have been claims the way South Yorkshire Police conducted themselves after 'The Battle of Orgreave' fed into their response to the Hillsborough disaster. There have been growing calls for some form of investigation to fully understand what happened during the miners' strike and how that may have shown a culture within the South Yorkshire force that endured long after. But it should also be remembered these are very different incidents. Nobody died at Orgreave. Although miners were put on trial, the cases collapsed so there was no miscarriage of justice. That said, the miners have always carried a sense of injustice about what happened. Their calls for an inquiry now have the backing of some of the Hillsborough families. It's up to the home secretary to decide what happens next. Mr Metcalf wrote a note saying he had been told some of the police statements did not match the video evidence at Orgreave. His note also records Mr Metcalfe as saying that he had been told that senior officers were reluctant to provide anything that might undermine the case. Last year, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had identified possible cases of attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to Orgreave. However, the police watchdog decided an investigation was not in the public interest. Former miners' union president Arthur Scargill has called for an inquiry into the Battle of Orgreave disorder. More than 120 officers and pickets were injured and 93 people were arrested following clashes at the coking plant. Campaigners have called on Dave Jones, the interim chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, to open up the force's archives on Orgreave. The Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign said it wanted Mr Jones to intervene in its legal bid to push Home Secretary Theresa May to hold a public inquiry. Mr Jones said he would \"welcome an appropriate independent assessment of Orgreave\". \"The Hillsborough inquests have brought into sharp focus the need to understand"

The rioting came after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a black man fatally injured in police custody in Baltimore. A week-long curfew has been announced and thousands of troops have been deployed to the city. The National Guard has been sent to Baltimore to stop unrest for the first time since 1968, when some of the city's neighbourhoods went up in flames after the assassination of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. On Tuesday evening, hundreds of protesters took to the streets to express their frustration with what they see as excessive police force. The peaceful demonstrations were a contrast to the day before, when about 200 people were arrested as more than 100 cars were set alight and 15 buildings destroyed. Mr Obama harshly criticised \"a handful of people\" for \"senseless violence and destruction\". \"That is not a protest, that is not a statement, they are stealing.\" But the US president said the rioting had distracted from the frustration over Gray's death. \"This has been a slow-rolling crisis. This has been going on for a long time. This is not new. And we shouldn't pretend that it's new,\" Mr Obama said. He added such problems would not be solved just by changes to policing. \"It would require everybody saying this is important, this is significant, and that we don't just pay attention to these communities when a CVS burns and we don't just pay attention when a young man gets shot or has his spine snapped.\" At an afternoon briefing, Baltimore Captain Eric Kowalczyk was asked why the police had not responded with more resources to prevent fires and rioting. He said police had originally deployed for a \"high school event\", expecting young students. \"I don't think there's anyone in the country that would expect us to deploy automatic weapons and armoured vehicles to an event with 13, 14 and 15 year olds,\" but saw it turned into an incident that drew in older troublemakers and escalated in violence. It's been hours since the CVS was set alight here at Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore, but fire fighters are still battling the flames. Earlier the stench of burning fumes filled the air as groups of people, armed with brooms and bin bags helped clear the mess from the night before. As the day progressed the crowds of protestors built up. A line of police, wearing full riot gear and carrying batons and shields have been blocking one of the road's here. For most of the afternoon protestors, danced and beat drums close by. There was the air of a carnival - a contrast to the violence this same area witnesses just the night before. At one point things did get a little tense. A conversation between protestors and police ended with pepper spray being directed at the crowds. But things have been calm overall. Protestors formed a human chain as the sun beat down on this bruised city. As nightfall a there'll be a curfew."

It was created by the Sandy Hook Promise group, set up by family members of the victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting. On December 14, 2012, 20 children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School by 20-year-old Adam Lanza, who had killed his own mother earlier that morning. He was a former student of the school. \"When you don't know what to look for or can't recognize what you are seeing, it can be easy to miss warning signs or dismiss them as unimportant,\" said Nicole Hockley from Sandy Hook Promise, whose son Dylan died in the shooting. \"Everyone has the power to intervene and get help. These actions can save lives.\" In the aftermath of the 2012 shooting, Barack Obama called for action on gun control, despite the political difficulties. But three years later, he called gun control the greatest frustration of his presidency, as the US Congress repeatedly blocked moves to tighten restrictions. The gun control movement reached a peak in the summer when more than 200 Democratic politicians staged a sit-in at the House of Representatives to demand a vote on restricting firearm purchases, in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida. The Gun Violence Archive non-profit organisation maintains a \"mass shooting tracker\" of attacks where four or more people were shot in a single incident. It estimates that so far in 2016, 425 people have been killed in 362 mass shootings in the United States. It says there were 333 mass shootings last year, and 275 two years ago. The new President-elect Donald Trump, however, frequently expressed support for the second amendment - the right to bear arms - during his campaign, saying his rival Hilary Clinton wanted to abolish it. On one occasion, he caused a significant controversy when he suggested gun rights supporters could somehow stop Ms Clinton's campaign. In May, the National Rifle Association, a pro-gun lobby, endorsed Mr Trump for president."

      "text": "The US company says the \"limited edition\" Toq is designed to showcase its new technologies rather than compete with its other products. Qualcomm is best known for making processors that power smartphones. However, one analyst suggested the device was too bulky to appeal beyond a niche enthusiast audience. The $349 (\u00c2\u00a3215) gadget is being made available via only Qualcomm's website to US customers, and the company said it was \"unlikely\" it would sell the watch elsewhere. The Toq is designed to be paired with any smartphone running Android 4.0.3 or higher. It allows its owner to receive and send text messages, manage reminders and view other information - such as weather forecasts or stock prices - obtained via their handset. There is no software store for the watch itself, but existing handset apps can be adapted to send details to its display and activate a vibrate function. In addition it can be used to accept or reject calls, and control what music is being played from the linked phone's library. The company says that the watch's key innovation is its use of its proprietary Mirasol technology. Rob Chandok, president of Qualcomm Interactive Platforms, described this as being similar to the e-ink displays commonly used by e-book readers and another smartwatch - the Pebble - but better. \"In addition to the fact it offers colour, the refresh rate of Mirasol can be 30 frames a second, which allows you to build a touch interface,\" he told the BBC. \"That's tremendously important when you are trying to offer some of these experiences. \"In an e-ink display you can't refresh the screen fast enough to follow the finger.\" Mirasol is significantly less power-hungry than the OLED tech used by Samsung's Galaxy Gear watch, meaning that unlike its rival, its screen does not have to turn itself off when angled away from the user's face to extend battery life. Sony's Smartwatch 2 does offer an always-on LCD display - however, it requires the user to switch on a backlight in dim conditions. Although Qualcomm suggests the Toq's lack of an on/off switch makes it the superior option, Mr Chandok acknowledged that the Toq display's graphics were not as vibrant or crisp as the alternatives. \"But we've got other versions of Mirasol in the pipeline that are going to have a better colour gamut and vibrancy,\" he added. Qualcomm has also included three other technologies it has developed that it hopes will attract the attention of manufacturers: Mr Chandok said \"tens of thousands, but not hundreds of thousands\" of the watches were being produced, adding that its appeal was likely to be limited to an \"early adopter\" crowd. \"We would consider making more if the demand were high,\" he said. \"But our preference is for our partners to bring out products [using the new technologies] in the next six months, and we're working hard with a few people to do that.\" He declined to name the companies involved, but did reveal that in theory the Toq could be made compatible with Apple's iPhones. \"We limited the spend"

      "text": "The Real Madrid striker appeared before a judge in Versailles after being held in custody overnight. His lawyer says he played \"no part\" in an alleged attempt to extort money from fellow French international Mathieu Valbuena. The two men reportedly had an exchange during a training session. According to French media, Mr Benzema mentioned the tape to the midfielder during a national team training session at Clairefontaine in early October. A source close to inquiry, quoted by told AFP news agency, said the 27-year-old star told investigators on Thursday he had approached Mr Valbuena about the tape on behalf of \"a childhood friend\". France coach Didier Deschamps left both players out of his squad selected on Thursday for matches against Germany and England later in November. The prosecutor's office earlier confirmed that Mr Benzema was now under formal investigation for complicity in attempted blackmail and participation in a criminal conspiracy. When a suspect is placed under formal investigation, he or she is then examined by a judge, who determines whether there is sufficient evidence for the suspect to be charged. If formal charges do follow and he is convicted, Mr Benzema could face a minimum jail sentence of five years, the prosecutor said. Meanwhile the court has banned the striker from contacting his France team-mate, or any other people charged in the case. Speaking to reporters after the ruling, Mr Benzema's lawyer, Sylvain Cormier, said his client was adamant he was not guilty of the charges. \"Karim Benzema has nothing to hide,\" he said. \"He supports his friend, Mathieu Valbuena, with all his heart. He took no part, I state this again - no part - in the blackmail or blackmail attempts.\" \"Karim Benzema will show he acted in good faith, and I hope this will be seen as soon as possible,\" Mr Cormier added. Whether or not the footballer is charged, correspondents say the formal investigation exposes him to a lengthy period of doubt ahead of the Euro 2016 tournament that France hosts next year. French coach Deschamps refused to comment on the legal case on Thursday but said Mr Benzema had been injured. He added that Lyon midfielder Mr Valbuena was not in an emotional state to play in upcoming games against Germany and England. Karim Benzema is the top scorer in the France team, so doubts about his participation at Euro 2016 represent a cloud over Les Bleus as they aim to make the most of their host status. The Real Madrid striker has scored 27 goals in 81 appearances for his country, more than double the number scored by fellow France striker Olivier Giroud, and apart from missing out at the 2010 World Cup, has been a mainstay in the team since making his debut in 2007. Benzema is regarded as one of Europe's top strikers, but despite winning honours at Real Madrid, he is yet to make a telling contribution at a major tournament for his country. Sources have told French media that a relative of Mr Benzema was contacted by the blackmailers, in an attempt to"

It is feared that the attack could leave US security personnel or their families open to blackmail. The agency involved, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), is yet to comment on the reports. Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to the Associated Press (AP) news agency, believe the attackers have targeted the forms submitted by intelligence and military personnel for security clearances. The document includes personal information - everything from eye colour, to financial history, to past substance abuse, as well as contact details for the individual's friends and relatives. A 127-page vetting document called Standard Form 86 may have been accessed. Among the questions potential employees are asked: A White House statement said investigators had a \"high degree of confidence\" that background information on government employees had been accessed. Joel Brenner, a former US counterintelligence official, called the data a \"gold mine\" for hackers. It is also believed the breach of personal data of US government workers announced last week may be far larger than previously reported. Initial estimates put the number of people potentially affected at four million, but officials close to the investigation told AP that as many as 14 million might be involved. The US has said the hackers, thought to be behind both attacks, are believed to be based in China. Beijing called the claims \"irresponsible\". The Obama administration meanwhile announced further measures to beef up cybersecurity on Friday. \"Recent events underscore the need to accelerate the administration's cyber strategy and confront aggressive, persistent malicious actors that continue to target our nation's cyber infrastructure,\" a White House statement said."

His wife Amanda has been campaigning for dementia and Alzheimer's awareness, and met with health secretary Alex Neil last month. Alzheimer Scotland joined football clubs and fans in paying tribute to Mr Kopel. Mr Kopel, who was inducted to the Dundee United Hall of Fame in 2011, started his career with Manchester United as a schoolboy in 1964. He made 12 appearances for the Old Trafford side, including a European appearance against Anderlecht, before moving to Blackburn Rovers in 1969. He was signed by United manager Jim McLean on New Year's Day 1972, and became a mainstay at the right-back position in a team which won back to back Scottish League Cup honours in 1979 and 1980, the club's first major trophies. After leaving Tannadice to take up a coaching position with Arbroath in 1982, he returned to United on several occasions to help out with the reserves. A spokesman for the club said: \"Our thoughts are with all of his family and friends at this very sad time. \"An indication of the affection with which he was held by all Arabs is illustrated by the fact that a supporters' club was named in his honour and by the genuinely warm welcome he received at the many functions and events he attended over the years.\" Alzheimer Scotland added: \"Deeply saddened to hear of the death of Frank Kopel. Our sincere condolences to his family and friends.\" Mr Kopel was diagnosed with a mixture of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease in 2009. His wife Amanda mounted a campaign to raise awareness of the strain on carers looking after people with early-onset dementia, and addressed the Scottish Parliament's public petitions committee. She has called for free personal care for dementia sufferers under 65, and health secretary Alex Neil pledged to bring her concerns to Parliament after meeting the couple at their Kirriemuir home last month."

Porridge will return for a special episode, again written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. Set 40 years on, Kevin Bishop will play Fletcher's prison inmate grandson. Nicknamed \"Fletch\" Fletcher, Nigel is behind bars for a series of cyber crimes. Beckinsale said in an interview for Radio 5 live, Afternoon Edition: \"I don't think that's such a terrible idea. I think that's quite nice really. \"When it's beloved characters and a beloved project, it's quite nice to have an imaginary, 'what is their grandson doing?'\" But Beckinsale, whose new film is Love & Friendship - a romantic comedy based on Jane Austen's novel Lady Susan - has no desire to make a cameo in her father's old show. \"In Porridge? You've got to be joking. It's a boy's prison. I'm not that versatile. Tea lady?\" Her father died from cardiac arrest at the age of 31 in 1979. He appeared in all three series of Porridge between 1974 and 1977 and finished making the film version a few weeks before his death. Beckinsale, who starred in 2012's reboot of Total Recall, which originally starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, does not now believe remakes are a good idea, she says. \"I think it's a shame sometimes when they take something that is almost perfect or perfect and then remake it. That's a silly idea. \"They should remake things that aren't very good and have another go at it.\" The new episode of Porridge will be broadcast this summer as part of a landmark sitcom season to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the start of Hancock's Half Hour on BBC TV. It will include contemporary follow-ups to Are You Being Served?, Keeping Up Appearances and Up Pompeii! while lost episodes of Steptoe and Son, Till Death Do Us Part and Hancock's Half Hour will be remade from their original scripts for BBC Four. The interview with Kate Beckinsale can be heard on Radio 5 live's Afternoon Edition on Tuesday 31 May at 1300. Love & Friendship is currently in UK cinemas."

That is about half the list price of the existing product, which is used in emergencies for severe food and insect allergies. The cost of EpiPens in the US has risen by 500% in less than a decade. Mylan said the generic version would be identical to the branded EpiPen, which costs $600 for two doses. Allergy sufferers often have several pens - one to keep at home, as well as others at school or work, or in the car. They also expire after 12 months. Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch said the company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving the product since buying the product from Merck in 2007. \"Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response,\" she said. \"We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option.\" The move is unusual because the branded version is still under patent and other rival treatments have failed to get regulatory clearance. The product generates annual sales of $1bn for Mylan. Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said: \"We suspect Mylan will continue to receive some heat for its price increases and there will be heightened pressure on FDA [regulator the Food and Drug Administration] to bring competition to the market.\" Ms Bresch also blamed the complex US health care system for the price rises and said that Mylan took just $274 of the $600 list price, while insurers, pharmacies and other parties shared the rest. How much individuals pay for an EpiPen prescription can depend on their insurance coverage. Politicians and parents have challenged the price hikes, with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton calling them \"outrageous\" and unjustified. The outcry over EpiPen price rises sent Mylan shares falling about 12% last week. The stock was flat at $43.04 in afternoon trading in New York. Actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who had endorsed EpiPens, said last week she was ending her relationship with Mylan. She had previously spoken about the importance of the treatment to her family because of her son's peanut allergy. Other drug makers including Valeant, Turing and Pfizer have come under fire in recent months for sharp price increases."

Police commissioner K P Raghuvanshi said the builders were arrested for allegedly paying bribes to police and municipal officials to construct the building in the Mumbai suburb of Thane without any official sanction. Mr Raghuvanshi said on Sunday that the nine would be formally charged with culpable homicide and causing death by negligence, once the investigation into the accident had been completed. If convicted, they face sentences of up to life in prison. Most of the victims of the Thane collapse were poor daily wage earners working at the site, and their families. The dead included 30 children and 18 women. Building work had continued at the block even though four floors were already occupied. One police official told the BBC that the collapse appeared to have been caused by the use of substandard building material. Witnesses said the construction of the building started just six weeks ago, since when seven floors had been built. The eighth floor was under construction. In a similar collapse in 2010, 69 people were killed in Delhi."

Judy Corbett, who owns Gwydir Castle with her husband, Peter Welford, said it was bought by William Randolph Hearst, an American newspaper tycoon in 1921. The 16th Century linen-fold panelling, the fireplace overmantel and the carved and moulded ceiling beams were dismantled, crated up and sent to America. \"He ended up assembling it in his billiard room in his apartment in New York,\" she said.

Was it donated to an American museum? \"We have spent years looking through archives and records but can find no trace of it anywhere.\" Numerous items of furniture, along with another whole room, were also sold off in 1921. The panelling from the dining room was also bought by Mr Hearst. But it was later discovered in a warehouse belonging to the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and was brought back to Wales and reinstalled at Gwydir in 1996.

      "text": "An announcement from steel firm Tata is expected on Tuesday on the future of its plants in Motherwell, Cambuslang and Scunthorpe in North Lincolnshire. It is believed about 1,200 jobs will be affected, including 400 in Scotland. The Scottish government said it continued to \"explore all options\" to find a viable future for Tata's sites. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told her party conference in Aberdeen on Saturday that \"if our worst fears are realised\", she would immediately establish a task force to work with the company, the trade unions and local authorities. Tata employs about 70 people at its Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang, with the remainder of its Scottish workforce based at its Dalzell plate rolling works in Motherwell. Trade union Community, which represents steel workers, said it wanted any task force to support a programme which would keep the plants open while a long-term solution was sought. Assistant general secretary John Park said: \"We are in the middle of the worst slump in steel prices in living memory and it is essential we maintain our capacity to produce steel in Scotland. \"We welcome Nicola Sturgeon's announcement of a steel task force, but it cannot simply be an exercise in managing decline. \"If the Scottish steel industry is to have a future, then Nicola Sturgeon must ensure the strategic assets at Dalzell and Clydebridge are maintained.\" Mr Park also called for a \"proper industrial strategy\" for the sector to be developed. He added: \"For steel to have that future we must secure the skills of the men and women who work in the industry. \"That is why we are calling on the Scottish government to support short-time working programme, should that be necessary over the coming weeks.\" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"Since last year, when Tata Steel first announced the potential sale of its long products division, the Scottish government and its agencies have been in constant contact with both Tata Steel and with the trades unions. \"We continue to be in contact to explore all possible options to find a viable future for the company's sites in Scotland.\" Labour MSP John Pentland said: \"When Grangemouth, Fergusons and Prestwick Airport were at risk, the Scottish government stepped in to provide support and to secure jobs. \"They need to do the same now - anything less will not be acceptable. \"This is an iconic industry for our nation and the men and women who work at Clydesdale and Dalzell deserve all possible support.\""

But no link was found between exposure to cigarette smoke in the womb and a decrease in fertility. The study examines data from 12,321 women born before 31 December 1972. The university said an analysis of the data also showed that women exposed to cigarette smoke in the womb were more likely to have a pregnancy than those whose mothers did not smoke. Women exposed to cigarette smoke in the womb were also likely to have a pregnancy earlier than those not exposed. Dr Sohinee Bhattacharya, a pregnancy and childbirth expert from the University of Aberdeen, said previous research had suggested there may be a \"small decrease\" in the fertility of women whose mothers smoked in pregnancy. \"This study used a databank in Aberdeen to look at the birth records of more than 12,000 women and followed them through for 40 years to see whether being born to a smoker had any impact on women's future fertility,\" she said. \"The study did not find a link between mothers' smoking and a decrease in fertility in their daughters. \"Women whose mothers smoked were more likely to have a pregnancy, but this study suggests that this could simply be linked to the fact that they were also more likely to get pregnant at an earlier age and could be related to socioeconomic status. \"Worryingly the study did find a significant increase in the chances of having a miscarriage among the women whose mothers had smoked when pregnant with them. \" The lead author of the paper, Sam Tweed, completed the work as part of his undergraduate degree and graduated from the University of Aberdeen's Medical School in June. The research was published in the Human Reproduction Open journal."

Shepherd's converted try and penalty saw Cornwall to a 10-6 half-time lead. Shepherd crossed again in the second half before Evan Stewart's late try for Lancashire ensured a nervy finish, but could not prevent only their second Twickenham final defeat in six years. Since 2009, Lancashire had only previously once lost the Bill Beaumont Cup, in 2012, when they were beaten by Hertfordshire. Shepherd missed a penalty in the opening minutes, but he made amends two minutes later, the Launceston scrum-half going in under the posts from 30 metres out. Steve Collins pulled a penalty back and Shepherd missed a three-point attempt of his own before Cornwall were reduced to 14 men on 27 minutes. Ben Hilton was sin-binned and Chris Johnson brought Lancashire back to within a point of their opponents from the resulting penalty. But Shepherd's penalty with five minutes left in the half, coming after Chris Briers' yellow card, ensured that the Duchy went in at the break with a 10-6 lead. Shepherd took his points tally for the County Championship to 66 when he went over shortly after the break following a line out from five metres out. That made it 15-6 and, although he failed to convert his own score, his Launceston teammate Searle pushed the gap into double figures with a 63rd minute penalty. Lancashire did not threaten Cornwall until the final 10 minutes when they put the Duchy under immense pressure. Searle was sin-binned for an infringement at the breakdown and Lancashire skipper Stewart crashed over with six minutes left, Johnson adding the extras. But Cornwall's 14 men stood firm to clinch a fourth county title.

The promoter has previously organised celebrity appearances in the UK by Sylvester Stallone, John Travolta and others. \"We have been advised by the promoters of An Evening with Liza Minnelli that the performance has been cancelled,\" the London Palladium said in a statement. \"All tickets will be refunded.\" Rocco Buonvino Productions and Minnelli's representatives have not responded to a request for a comment. Minnelli, the daughter of Hollywood legend Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli, won an Academy Award for her role in 1972 film Cabaret. She is one of a handful of stars to have won the so-called Egot - an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. In March, the 69-year-old was admitted to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit for treatment of substance abuse.

Failure to pay the fine, or to stop a vehicle and give personal details to the police could lead to a prosecution and 1,000 euros (\u00a3727) penalty. A similar ban is being considered by the Northern Ireland Assembly. Earlier this month, Stormont Health Minister Simon Hamilton announced an amendment to a bill currently going through the assembly, which if passed, would now mean smoking in cars with children would be illegal anywhere on the island of Ireland. The Irish government signed its ban into law this week, under the Protection of Children's Health (Tobacco Smoke in Mechanically Propelled Vehicles) Act. The details were announced by Minister for Children Dr James Reilly and Minister for Health Leo Varadkar. Mr Reilly said it was a central part of his government's \"Tobacco Free Ireland\" policy. \"The Irish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Study 2014 found that nearly one in every five children between the ages of 10 and 17 years are exposed to toxic, carcinogenic smoke in cars,\" he said. \"Even if windows of the car are open the young person is not protected from the harmful effect of second-hand smoke.\" Mr Varadkar said: \"Children are more susceptible to the effects of second-hand smoke and may not be able to avoid exposure. \"Second hand smoke is particularly harmful to children in enclosed spaces, such as cars.\" Under the new law, drivers and passengers will be banned from smoking cigarettes, cigars or pipes when they are inside a vehicle with someone under the age of 18. Drivers will also be held responsible if they allow their passengers to smoke in front of children. The legislation does not apply to electronic cigarettes, which are exempt from the ban. In Great Britain, a law banning smoking in vehicles carrying children came into force in England and Wales in October. The Scotland government is planning to legislate on the issue next year."

Supported by eight former children's laureates, Riddell is asking Ms Greening to set out required standards. The government said it was up to schools to spend as they saw fit. In his letter, Riddell, supported by authors such as Michael Morpurgo, Jacqueline Wilson and Quentin Blake, said: \" I have seen personally, in my school visits up and down the country, how they promote reading for pleasure and in doing so, turn pupils into avid readers. \"I am deeply concerned that this role is not fully appreciated and, worse, is being undermined through lack of economic and intellectual investment. \"In recent months two major school library services closed in Dorset and Berkshire, and year after year the School Library Association loses members as school library provision shrinks through lack of funding.\" He said he had seen how library provision was \"wildly inconsistent\", with great examples of well-funded and staffed libraries. He said the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Libraries had asked the DfE to gather statistics on school library provision so that the extent of this problem could be understood, but this had not yet happened. Riddell also said: \"While schools face insidious pressure on budgets and staff, things cannot change. \"That is why, with the backing of my fellow laureates, I am now calling on Justine Greening and the Department of Education to act on the all-party group's request and then set out clear standards of library provision, and put into place the necessary funding.\" This way, every school would have a library service it could be proud of, with books to borrow and, wherever possible, a school librarian to help children choose, he said. A Department for Education official said reading was a key part of a child's education and ultimately helped them to reach their full potential. \"That's why we've strengthened the curriculum to focus on developing their reading and writing skills, and teaching phonics helps children acquire the basic building blocks of reading,\" the official said. \"We want all children to have the opportunity to read widely - school libraries play a role in this, and schools are responsible for deciding how to provide this service for their pupils. \"This is backed up by a record \u00c2\u00a340bn schools budget this year, and it is up schools to spend their funding as they see fit.\""

Farmers have warned they will go out of business if they do not receive higher prices for milk. They have held protests at supermarkets to show their frustration that they are currently paid less than the cost of production. Mrs O'Neill added: \"I and farming industry representatives from Northern Ireland were also adamant that pursuing opportunities in opening new markets tomorrow will not address the crisis our farmers are facing today.\" The minister and the representatives were joined at the meeting by their counterparts from Scotland, Wales and the UK's farming unions. The meeting was called to address a number of issues facing the farming industry, especially the dairy sector. \"It is clear that European support for our farmers is vital right now,\" said Mrs O'Neill. \"The dairy sector in Northern Ireland, which is heavily reliant on exports, has been hit hard by adverse exchange rates and poor market conditions. \"Farm gate milk prices are now below the cost of production. Assistance is required. Our circumstances are unique and extreme. \"While it is good that my counterparts in Wales and Scotland are committed to influencing Liz Truss to act speedily, I am clear that raising the intervention price threshold is the key lever to effect positive change in the short term.\" The minister intends to ask the EU Commissioner Phil Hogan to raise the intervention threshold price when she meets him in September. She will also attend the specially-convened Agriculture Council in Brussels on 7 September. Environment Secretary Ms Truss said: \"I recognise the seriousness of the current situation for the dairy industry and for farming as a whole. \"Our hard working farmers and the \u00c2\u00a3100bn food and farming industry are vital for our economy and our countryside. \"I want to see this situation taken seriously by the EU who have the means to help farmers manage this volatility and build resilience.\" Earlier, Mrs O'Neill said: \"The Northern Ireland dairy farming industry is probably in the worst condition it has ever been.\" Ulster Farmers Union president Ian Marshall also attended the meeting. He said a united front would help influence the European Commissioner Paul Hogan in attempts to get Brussels to intervene and support the price of milk \"When the unions went out and spoke to Phil Hogan a number of months ago, certainly Northern Ireland was a lone voice,\" he said. \"The landscape has changed now in that other member states are certainly applying pressure to the commissioner and we have no doubt that he's coming under immense pressure to revisit the discussion on intervention.\""

They had slipped to 208-6 with Essex seamer Matt Dixon taking two wickets in two balls with figures of 4-89. But Stevens shared a partnership of 108 with James Tredwell (39) and completed his 31st first-class ton in the final over of the day at Canterbury. It was an unflappable display from the 40-year-old, who was patient at first but then showed all his attacking prowess, at one point adding 26 in the space of nine balls faced. When Tredwell was lbw to Dixon, Stevens added an unbroken 73 with Matt Coles, giving Kent four bonus points and leaving them only two short of guaranteeing second place. The score at stumps was probably a fair reflection on the way Essex bowled - a one-paced attack short of a front-line spinner. Joe Denly (74) and Sam Northeast (56) shared 109 for the third wicket, taking advantage as Essex often over-pitched. Dixon, on his return to the first team, was the pick of the attack as he swung the ball at decent pace, removing Denly and Will Gidman in successive deliveries after Ravi Bopara trapped Sam Billings lbw. The mini-collapse from 204-3 to 208-6 had Essex in the game, only for Stevens to take it away from them. But what is now a three-day match will be difficult for either side to win."

The saucy \"double entendre\" that's been enlivening local social media is an appropriate piece of signposting for a town where passions run deep and local politics is anything but the dreary, humdrum business of general repute. Although in fairness, we should point out that the council has now responded by repainting the offending road markings since this \"hot button\" image was recorded for posterity. For this is a town with a very acute sense of itself. Traditionally the home of the leather industry, Walsall has a football team known as the Saddlers. They are mounting a spirited challenge for promotion to the second tier of English football, the Skybet Championship. There they would rub shoulders with an assortment of local rivals including the newly-relegated star attractions, Aston Villa. At the centre of the town, is the art gallery which opened 16 years ago to widespread international acclaim. It is home to works by, among others, Jacob Epstein, Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh and Turner. No less significantly, it has provided a catalyst for the economic regeneration of the area surrounding the canal basin, like a smaller version of Birmingham's famous Gas Street. And Walsall really is like a microcosm of the political landscape of our part of the country as a whole. It's like all our famous marginals rolled into one electoral battlefield. Or is it a minefield more like? It has long been a predominantly two-party affair: the map shows the west of the town, leaning towards the rest of the Black Country, almost exclusively Labour red. While the east, inclining towards Birmingham's leafy stockbroker belt in neighbouring Four Oaks and Little Aston, is an exclusively blue Conservative preserve. And within the council, where one third of the 60 seats are up for election, the numbers reflect the changeable political weather in a region well-known for swinging back and forth between the two biggest parties. It is a significant weather vane. Labour and the Conservatives have both had long periods in over-all control. But this is a council is famous for its knife-edge outcomes producing no outright majority, with all the back room deal-making and deal-breaking that entails. A year ago the town had a minority Labour administration. But last June, the indefatigable Conservative group leader Mike Bird brokered a minority administration even though Labour have two more seats than his party. He wrestled-back the leadership of the council with the support of the three UKIP and two Independent councillors. A town that's grown accustomed to living on a political knife-edge now faces another equally cut-throat encounter. Labour's fortunes hit a notable high the last time this particular set of seats were contested four years ago, so this time round they appear to have far more to lose than to gain. They must defend nine of their 27 seats while the Conservatives defend seven of their 25. With both"

A court heard they targeted Hussell's ex-boyfriend, who lost his job after he was wrongfully arrested. Fendall was jailed for 19 months and Hussell was sentenced to 16 months. The pair provided false information to the charity Crimestoppers, naming Hussell's former boyfriend as being responsible for a fail-to-stop collision in which another PCSO was injured. Brett Gerrity, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: \"Thomas Fendall and Jessica Hussell, who were in a personal relationship, abused their positions within the police to access restricted material on the police computer system for their own use and to settle a personal grievance. \"Fendall used the police computer system to research background information on people he and Hussell knew, and shared information and documents with others. \"They provided Crimestoppers with bogus information leading to an innocent man being investigated by the police for attempted murder.\" He continued: \"They also supplied the DVLA with fictitious intelligence, which led to the same man having his driving licence revoked. \"He had to prove he was medically fit to drive before his licence could be reinstated two months later.\" Sergeant Lee Westhead, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: \"The actions of Fendall and Hussell undermine everything that is at the heart of policing in this country.\" Hussell, 19, from Glossop, and Fendall, 26, from Denton, each pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office. They also pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice in relation to providing false information to Crimestoppers. Fendall had pleaded guilty to another count of misconduct in a public office and four counts of computer misuse relating to the GMP intelligence system. The pair were arrested in August 2015 after an investigation by GMP's Serious Collision investigation Unit. They were suspended from GMP upon arrest."

Fire crews have been called to the site several times, most recently at the weekend. Nottinghamshire County Council said an Enforcement Notice to clear the site by 1 September had been served. According to people living nearby, much of the waste had been stored in large plastic bundles but these had been opened when fires started. Jonathan Smith, from the council, confirmed they had served the notice in April. He said: \"This activity has been done without planning permission and without the prior knowledge of the county council. \"An enforcement notice requiring the removal of all waste from the site and restoration to its former condition has been served on the landowners and other parties who we believe have an interest in the site.\" If this is not obeyed the council can clear the land and recover costs and the landowner could face court action. Tessa Bunby posted on a Cotgrave Facebook page: \"I'm sure there is a process to these things but the [local authority] being aware since April is mind-boggling\". Resident Drew Willie said: \"You only have to look at it, it is disgusting and it is going to cost a fortune to clean it up. \"There is probably a lot of hazardous waste, the kids are going to come up here and set fire to it again and the fire brigade will have to come and put it out. \"And it is just a waste of resources, all from somebody being irresponsible and dumping stuff here they shouldn't.\""

      "text": "The 30-year-old Manxman initially remounted after crashing about 20km into the sixth stage of the race from Stoke to Nottingham before pulling out. His Etixx-Quick-Step team believe he hit a parked car, injuring the same left shoulder he dislocated during the 2014 Tour de France. Cavendish sustained bruising but no fracture or dislocation of the joint. But he will require several days of rest before being able to resume training. The crash came on the day he was named in Britain's team for this month's UCI Road World Championships, which start next weekend. But the men's road race is over a fortnight away on Sunday, 27 September, and Cavendish's team believe it is still possible he will be able to compete in the event in Virginia, the United States. Friday's sixth stage - a 192.7 km route across the Peak District National Park - was won by Cavendish's Etixx-Quick-Step team-mate Matteo Trentin. The Italian rider beat Edvald Boasson Hagen (MTN-Qhubeka) as the duo battled for the stage win. Norwegian Boasson Hagen, the 2009 Tour of Britain winner, earned enough bonus seconds to enhance his overall lead to 13 seconds ahead of the final two stages this weekend. Saturday's 227.1km seventh stage from Fakenham to Ipswich is likely to be the final chance for Boasson Hagen's rivals - chiefly Team Sky's Wout Poels - to dethrone him as Sunday's finish in central London is expected to end in a sprint. \"Stoke and Nottingham are only 50 flattish miles apart if you go via the A50; do it via Buxton, Hathersage and Bakewell and it could just break you. \"The day's victor Matteo Trentin, who has also won two Tour de France stages, said it was the hardest ride of his career. \"There may be a hint of hyberbole to that - forgiveable given the way he resisted a very elite chasing group and surged past Edvald Boasson Hagen at the death - but I cannot remember a day at the Tour of Britain when the main bunch came in 45 minutes later. \"It was a third win this week for the Etixx-Quick-Step team and it came on the day they lost their third rider, Britain's Mark Cavendish. It seems his injuries are not as serious as first feared. \"And for Boasson Hagen there is the consolation that despite Team Sky's best efforts he has almost certainly wrapped up the overall win.\" Stage 6 result 1.

It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. \"The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months.\" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: \"Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. \"An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. \"A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum.\" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. \"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\""

In Malaysia and Singapore, people are advised to stay indoors when the haze is bad, avoid exercise and wear N95 masks - high quality protection against particles in the air. But in Kalimantan \"a lot of people do not even wear masks here because they are so used to the pollution,\" relief worker Jonathan How told the BBC. \"They've been conditioned by the haze for decades and are subjected to serious health problems much worse than in Singapore.\" This week, Mr How took a team from Singapore to Kalimantan. Their mission: to raise awareness about the dangerous air pollution and distribute 25,000 of the N95 masks. He described seeing \"smoky yellow skies\" in the region, where PSI pollutant levels have neared 2,000. Any reading over 300 is considered hazardous. The team of five arrived in Kalimantan on Monday, where they spent three days visiting local schools and hospitals to distribute masks. \"One lesson we learnt was that haze awareness is key. Though people may politely receive the N95 masks they are given, they will only use them if they truly understand the long-term health impacts of inhaling fine particulates from the haze,\" Mr How said. Singaporean photographer Edwin Koo, who also travelled with the team, documented their efforts. He shared with the BBC one experience of teaching a man how to put on a specialised N95 mask. \"When we first arrived at the airport, we gave out masks to the porters too. One of them took the strap [that were supposed to be looped over the head] and wore it on his ears, like a surgical mask. It ended up blocking his eyes and he didn't realize it was wrongly worn. So I showed him how to put it on correctly. It was then I realised that the mission was not as simple as it seemed.\" Mr Koo also said: \"Sometimes we have to cross the line of documentation. In this case, it meant that I had to put my camera down to help people put on masks and explain the hazards of exposing oneself to haze.\" Mr Koo has also been actively sharing images from the trip onto his Facebook page. His album titled, Haze Response Kalimantan 2015, features photographs of Kalimantan's burning peatlands and the daily life of the locals. Now back in Singapore, Jonathan How and the team are currently exploring new ideas on how to \"better inform people about the negative health impact of the haze\". They also want to continue to \"encourage people to use the correct masks for their protection\". \"We want to meet as many like-minded individuals and organisations as possible, to explore collaboration on longer-term solutions to the haze,\" he said. \"The regional pollution is a global responsibility, not just of the Indonesian government.\""

The Department for Education has said it will not comment on the leaks. Birmingham council has released its own report, disagreeing with Mr Clarke. We must acknowledge today that Ian Kershaw's report shows we have serious governance issues in a small number of schools in east Birmingham because of serious malpractice by members of governing bodies. This has been compounded by the inability of head teachers and other governors to counter this behaviour and by the failure of the city council to intervene to instil proper governance. Council response in full Trojan Horse 'plot' schools timeline Reaction to 'Trojan Horse' reports The government's report was compiled by retired senior police officer Peter Clarke, the former head of the Met Police's counter-terrorism unit. It is due to be published next week. It says he found evidence of \"sustained and co-ordinated agenda to impose upon children in a number of Birmingham schools the segregationist attitudes and practices of a hardline and politicised strain of Sunni Islam\". He also found evidence of a \"co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamist ethos into some schools in the city\". The agenda would have confined \"schoolchildren within an intolerant, inward-looking monoculture that would severely inhibit their participation in the life of modern Britain,\" the leaked report says. A spokesman for the DfE said: \"The allegations made in relation to some schools in Birmingham are very serious and we are investigating all evidence put to us in conjunction with Ofsted and Birmingham City Council.\" Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said his union was disturbed by the Clarke review findings but not surprised. They reflected concerns raised in May about improper governance and staffing and \"a narrowing of entitlement for children\", he said. \"We do not need an over-reaction. This is not a criticism of the Islamic faith, but of a narrow current within it,\" he said. Birmingham's report, compiled by former head teacher Ian Kershaw, differed in its conclusions. It said there was \"no evidence of a conspiracy to promote an anti-British agenda, violent extremism or radicalisation in schools\" in the east of the city. Mr Kershaw did find \"key individuals\" promoting Islamic principles in schools and \"noted a pattern of these individuals moving between schools\". He did not conclude whether the original \"Trojan Horse\" letter was a hoax, as has been claimed. An unhelpful epitaph for Gove'Islam plot': Will we ever learn the truth? But he found evidence that the \"five steps\" outlined in the original letter as a means of destabilising school leadership were \"present in a large number of the schools considered part of the investigation\". His report said evidence pointed to a group of \"British male governors and teachers, predominantly of Pakistani heritage\", which have formed in order to address perceived failings in some schools. Mr Kershaw said the tactics employed by these groups were often \"improper\" and there was"

Up to 400 people are thought to have been inside. Survivors say the fireworks caused the ceiling and a pillar to catch fire and produce heavy smoke. A stampede for the exit followed. More than 140 people are being treated in hospital, some with severe burns. On Sunday officials said all of the dead had been identified. Romania has declared three days of national mourning."

      "text": "The former striker, still remarkably fresh faced for 40, is now attempting to make an impact as a Premier League manager at Cardiff City, having spent three seasons in his native Norway in charge of Molde. One of the biggest things he did was make the players feel more confident. It wasn't magic - it was paying attention to the details His spell there brought two top-flight titles, the first in Molde's history, as well as a Norwegian Cup as he quickly established a reputation as a promising young manager. Those who know Solskjaer describe him as mild mannered and gentle, with a knack for getting the best out of players and a desire to play attacking football. They also call him tough-minded and ambitious. But how will a manager used to \"complete control\" of team affairs fare in one of Europe's most unforgiving leagues and under one of the Premier League's more controversial owners in Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan? \"He showed he is a good manager in the short time he was here at Molde,\" says the club's Norway international goalkeeper Espen Bugge Pettersen. \"There is no reason why he should not be successful. \"He probably has not changed a lot since his playing days. He is a mild and gentle guy but when it is needed he can put his foot down. \"You won't find anyone who has a bad word to say about him, because they don't exist. He isn't afraid of making the tough decisions but he does it the right way and if he is not satisfied he will let you know.\" Solskjaer, scorer of Manchester United's injury-time winner in their 1999 Champions League final triumph over Bayern Munich, ended his 11-year playing career at Old Trafford with six Premier League titles and two FA Cups to add to that Champions League winners' medal. Injuries disrupted his final few years as a player and he was then offered a coaching role at the club by Sir Alex Ferguson, where as reserve team boss he won the Manchester Senior Cup, the Lancashire Senior Cup and the Premier League reserve play-offs. \"Ole always wanted to stay in the game, so from an early age he was preparing to stay in the game as a coach or as a manager,\" Ferguson told the Manchester Evening News in 2012. \"He was always one of the professionals who used to take down all the notes from the training sessions and games. He has got an inner toughness, there's no doubt about that.\" Given his first senior managerial role at Molde in 2011, Solskjaer delivered instant success at the club from which Manchester United had signed him in 1996. A first Tippeligaen title in the club's 100-year history arrived in his first season, breaking the dominance of Rosenberg, who had won 16 of the previous 19 championships, followed by a successful title defence and then the Norwegian Cup in November. \"Molde is a small place with 25,000 to 30,000 people,\" says Jonas Bergh-Johnsen, a journalist for Norwegian TV channel TV2. \"It is small"

The region where the earthquake struck - Kumamoto - is a manufacturing hub for many Japanese companies, including Sony and carmakers Toyota and Honda. Sony said, \"With aftershocks continuing and employee safety the foremost priority, inspections of the facility and the development of a recovery plan remain ongoing.\" The Kumamoto Technology Center is the main manufacturing site of image sensors for the firm's digital and security cameras, as well as micro-display devices. Last year, Sony decided to spin off its video-and-audio business into a separate company as part of a three-year plan to return to profit. Chief executive Kazuo Hirai said the company must not be afraid to change if it hoped \"to grow in a Sony-like way\". He said the Japanese electronics firm would no longer pursue sales growth in areas such as smartphones where it has suffered competition from rivals Apple and Samsung. Mr Hirai said instead it would focus on profitable businesses areas, including entertainment operations such as TV programming and the PlayStation game business."

The St Michael's development plan includes a five-star hotel, apartments, offices and a synagogue.

Andrew Braddock, from trade body UK Tram, said the accident should be \"set in the context of an extremely safe mode of transport\". \"You are 15 times safer travelling on a tram than you would be in a bus, 24 times safer than you would be in a car,\" he said. \"We had a dreadful incident in Croydon yesterday, there's absolutely no getting away from that, but it's extremely rare.\" British Transport Police are investigating whether the Croydon tram was exceeding speed limits and the possibility the driver may have fallen asleep or blacked out. The crash is believed to be the first involving fatalities on board a tram in the UK since 1959, when two women passengers and the driver died when a tram caught fire in Glasgow after a collision with a lorry. Deaths from tram derailments are rare around the world. Several people died and around 50 were injured when a tram overturned in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil in August 2011, while around 30 were killed and 50 injured when a tram derailed in eastern Ukraine in July 1996. Trams were phased out in the UK at the end of 1962 with the closure of the Glasgow network, leaving Blackpool's as the only one running. A new generation of tramways began with the opening of the Manchester Metrolink in 1992, and there are now also networks in Sheffield, Birmingham, London, Nottingham and Edinburgh, and about 300 worldwide. There were no trams in London between 1952 and 2000, when the London Tramlink opened. Mr Braddock described trams as being like a \"bus on rails\", travelling at similar speeds and peaking in cities at about 50mph. Powered by electricity through overhead wires, drivers control the vehicle using a lever - usually with their left hand - pushing forward to accelerate, backwards to brake and with a neutral stopping point in the middle. But unlike trains, trams are not fitted with systems that apply brakes automatically if they are going too fast or jump a light. The key safety feature is a vigilance device, known in the railway industry as the \"dead man's lever\" - a device that brakes automatically if the driver is incapacitated. Mr Braddock said: \"On the tram control lever there is a button which the driver presses at least every 30 seconds. If that button is not pressed the brakes are applied automatically. \"It makes no difference if the driver is powering up or braking, he has to keep pressing that button. It's a routine that you get into.\" If the driver lets go, the lever springs back to the neutral position, automatically applying the brakes. There is also an emergency stop button, bringing the tram to an immediate stop in the eventuality of an emergency such as a car or pedestrian suddenly appearing in front of it. There were 112 accidents involving trams in the year to the end of March, according to"

The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about \u00a31bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give \u00a3500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing \u00a3130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where \u00a344m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead. A wide range of other infrastructure projects across the eight council areas will also be discussed."

He remained on the inquiry team last year after the resignation of the chairwoman, Susan O'Brien QC, and panel member Prof Michael Lamb. One survivors' group said it was \"indicative of a crisis\" in the inquiry which is examining allegations of child abuse in residential accommodation. Andi Lavery, spokesman for the survivors' group White Flowers Alba, said victims were rapidly losing confidence in the inquiry's credibility. And Alan Draper, from In Care Abuse Survivors, said survivors were \"at a loss\" to understand what was happening. He told BBC Scotland: \"There is concern that the inquiry is dominated by the legal profession, without any balance from other professional groups who have a detailed knowledge of child abuse and its impact and implications for survivors and their families. \"Survivors are considering withdrawing from this whole process until they are satisfied that survivors are placed at the centre of the inquiry. \"The inquiry is about what happened to them and the failure of the establishment to protect them from harm. This failure is continuing.\" The probe is due to report in late 2019. Mr Houston said a \"change in priorities\" in his working life meant he had applied for positions at the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and the Disclosure and Barring Service. \"I have now been successful in those applications and the appointments have been made,\" he said. \"Lady Smith and I have discussed the potential that at some future time, a perception of conflict of interest may arise between these appointments and my work as a panel member on the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry. \"After careful consideration of both the time commitment required to fulfil these new roles and the potential, however small, for perceptions to arise of conflict of interest, I have tendered my resignation to the inquiry.\" Mr Houston added that he had been \"honoured\" to be appointed to the panel. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he had accepted the resignation of Mr Houston and thanked him for his positive contribution. \"I know this was not an easy decision for him to reach, but he can be very proud of the contribution he has made to the establishment of the Child Abuse Inquiry and to ensuring its continuing progress,\" he said. In July 2016, senior judge Lady Smith was appointed as the new chairwoman of the inquiry following Ms O'Brien's resignation. A successor to Mr Houston will not be appointed to the inquiry so Lady Smith will continue as the sole panel member. The Scottish government said this brought it in line with other public inquiries established in Scotland under the 2005 Inquiries Act. The abuse inquiry has been plagued by problems since it was set up in October 2015. More than \u00c2\u00a33.5m has been spent on it during this period. Prof Lamb resigned in June 2016 claiming the inquiry was \"doomed\". Ms O'Brien stood down days later after being told she faced the sack over \"unacceptable\" comments about child sex abuse victims.

Whether or not either Turk will delight enough to be hits with their new clubs, it is another loanee who has the potential to set Celtic Park alight if he lives up to his market value. Patrick Roberts moved to Manchester City in the summer for about \u00a312m and the 18-year-old winger has 18 months with the reigning Scottish champions in which to prove himself worthy of the fee paid to Fulham. Kazim-Richards is perhaps even more of a gamble, not only because of his off-field antics but also for a lack of career goals, and steady Erik Sviatchenko is maybe a safer bet to prove worthy of the \u00a31.5m Celtic paid Midtjylland for the Denmark defender. Celtic might need to squeeze every last pound of value out of their new arrivals to thwart a sustained Aberdeen title challenge that appears to have surprised even those inside Pittodrie. The Dandies' deadline-day signing of Simon Church on loan from MK Dons means they have a striker hungry for goals to ensure his place in Wales' Euro 2016 finals squad. However, the Dons may live to regret their bungled attempt to sign Greg Tansey from Inverness Caledonian Thistle in events that left them minus the additional cover in central midfield manager Derek McInnes thought necessary. While they brought in two replacements, the recall by Liverpool of promising goalkeeper Danny Ward could also prove costly in the long run. Third-top Hearts made the biggest profit during January as they arranged a deal that should mean they pocket more than \u00a31m for the sale of Osman Sow to Henan Jianye, who also bought Ryan McGowan from Dundee United, as the Chinese Super League begins to flex its financial muscle. The Edinburgh club have replaced the Swede with Abiola Dauda, a Nigerian striker on loan from Vitesse who has an even more impressive scoring record.

One of the guests on the boat had just had a hip replacement, one could not swim and the other was over 80, his father said.

It was only afterwards that \"shock started to set in\", Mr Watmore Snr said. \"All the guests were coming up to him and telling him what a hero he was and I think the whole thing was just very disorientating for him,\" he said.

Nursing is not on the Shortage Occupation List, giving priority to migrants with specific qualifications. UK ministers said they took independent advice on the list and the long-term aim was to \"train our own nurses\". Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: \"We have argued in favour of including nursing on the list. It seems essential to me. It is just a wrongheaded focus on the wrong issue that is leading them to refuse to do that. I've argued as well for a separate Welsh Shortage Occupation List.\" Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust, which serves mid Wales patients, could not recruit the nurses because it had been unable to get certificates of sponsorship from the Home Office, according to the email. Trust Communications director Adrian Osborne sent the message to MPs and AMs in mid Wales, Shropshire and Telford & Wrekin. He wrote: \"Alongside our local recruitment and training programmes, we had also implemented an international recruitment programme focused on the Philippines. \"This has faced delays as we have not been successful in securing Certificates of Sponsorship from the Home Office to bring these nurses to our wards. \"This is because nursing is neither on the Shortage Occupation List, nor do these posts secure enough points for them to be a priority for the Migration Advisory Committee.\" Lib Dem AM William Powell has written to the UK government calling for a change to the policy. \"The Tories' irresponsible and illogical attitude to immigration is contributing to an NHS staffing crisis in Wales,\" he said. \"What kind of government wants to stop vitally needed nurses coming to work in our country? This is reckless in the extreme. \"Of course we need to be training nurses in this country and we need a clear strategy to train our workforce for the future, but patients need support now, not in ten years' time.\" In a letter to Mr Powell, Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: \"The UK government believes that in the past it has been too easy for employers to bring in workers from overseas rather than take the long-term decision to train our workforce here at home. \"The long-term aim is that we train our own nurses in this country. \"A number of health professional jobs, such as doctors in emergency medicine, are recognised shortage occupations, but the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) recently recommended against adding nurses to the Shortage Occupation List.\""

The men, who are all from the Birmingham and Liverpool areas, are alleged to have stolen a car from an address in Arbroath, broken into the Co-op store in Carnoustie's Barry Street and stolen an ATM. It is also alleged that one of the men drove a stolen car with false licence plates and repeatedly reversed into another car at the Westway Retail Park in Arbroath while police were standing behind the vehicle.

The men needed regular visits because they could suffer a relapse which could put the public at risk. Ms Doherty denied any wrongdoing but three allegations were found proven. A fourth charge of acting \"dishonestly\" was found not proven. The hearing was told Ms Doherty worked for Vale of Glamorgan council as a senior social worker and had years of experience. Part of her job was to make sure people who had committed \"significant crimes\" but were living in the community, complied with Crown Court orders issued under the Mental Health Act. Ms Doherty said visits had happened every six weeks but council mental health services manager Andrew Cole, giving evidence on the first of a two-day hearing, said the visits were less frequent. \"[This led] to a potential increased risk of somebody's mental health deteriorating and an escalation in their behaviour - which is more likely to go undetected,\" he said. Mr Cole also said the minimum four-week frequency of visits was set by doctors and would have been \"clearly marked\" on official documents. In her evidence, Ms Doherty told the panel she often had an excessive work-load, inadequate management support and often felt \"left out on a limb\". The hearing was also told that bereavement had caused her to \"burn out\" and that her life had become \"chaotic\" as a result. Ms Doherty, who had been subject to a suspension order since the allegations came to light in 2014, told the hearing she was not seeking to return to social care. A report by the care watchdog said: \"The committee finds that only a Removal Order will be adequate in this case given the seriousness of the impairment.\""

      "text": "Research by MigrationWatch, which campaigns for tighter immigration controls, looked at employment status, wages and benefit claims. Migrants from the US, Australia and South Africa were found to earn much more than the UK-born population. By contrast, people from Pakistan and Bangladesh tended to earn much less, the research suggested. The study used data from the official Labour Force Survey of 100,000 people. It suggests: It also suggests that more migrants than UK-born people claim housing benefit, tax credits and child benefit. However, claims for Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance differ little between migrants and UK-born people. Migrant claims were noticeably lower for sickness and disability benefits and carers' allowances, the study suggests. MigrationWatch chairman, Lord Green of Deddington, said the analysis showed that the argument that all immigration to the UK was beneficial could not possibly be right. He said any sensible policy should take account of the real differences in economic characteristics between migrants from different parts of the world. \"If immigration policy has been intended to attract only 'the brightest and the best' it has clearly failed, with a very large number of migrants earning less or claiming more than the British-born,\" he added. \"The clear message of this research is that immigration can be reduced substantially while permitting entry to those migrants that our economy really needs.\" The effect migrants have on a host economy depends on their skills, those of workers in the host country and other factors including rules relating to employment and wages. British research tends to indicate that migrants have two impacts. Medium and high-paid workers gain, partly because they benefit from the cheaper services of the low-paid migrant workers. But the lowest paid resident workers can lose out in competition at the bottom. Further data suggests that immigration from outside the EU could lead to more unemployment of UK workers during a recession - but these effects can change over time if migration leads to greater employment, productivity and business opportunities. A recent study found the biggest losers could be existing migrants who find themselves in competition with newly arrived workers who have similar skills at a lower price. Source: Oxford University's Migration Observatory Neil Carberry, of business lobby group the CBI, said the evidence clearly showed the \"vast majority\" of migrants came to the UK to study or work, not to claim benefits. The government was right to pursue a managed immigration policy, he told the BBC, but warned a one-size-fits-all approach that did not recognise different types of migration should be resisted and making assumptions based on migrants' home countries added little to the debate. Don Flynn, director of charity Migrants' Rights Network, said the analysis appeared to be spun to suggest that migrants were more likely to receive benefits than UK-born people, and some migrants were poor performers. But, he said, the overall position remained that migrants performed better than their cost to the taxpayer, and there was nothing in the study to challenge that. He added the government should focus on making sure often highly-qualified migrants were employed in"

The force said it has informed Operation Hydrant, which oversees allegations of historical child sex abuse against high-profile people. Lord Tonypandy, who was born in Port Talbot, died of cancer in 1997 aged 88. Then known as George Thomas, he was a Labour MP in Cardiff from 1945 to 1983. The methodist preacher was also Secretary of State for Wales from 1968 to 1970 and was Commons Speaker between 1976 and 1983. Allegations of historical child sexual abuse were made against him four years ago. A man, now in his fifties, living in Australia, alleged that Lord Tonypandy had sexually assaulted him in Cardiff when he was nine years old while he was staying at the boy's parents home in the 1960s and 1970s. Other allegations against him included that he sexually assaulted a 16 or 17-year-old boy on a train between Newport and London in the 1960s. There were also claims he inappropriately touched someone on a train from London to Aberystwyth in 1959. On Wednesday, South Wales Police said its investigation has come to an end and that no further action would be taken. \"These allegations have been investigated proportionately by South Wales Police in line with national guidance,\" it said in a statement. \"The force takes all allegations of sexual abuse seriously no matter when the alleged offence took place and encourages any victims of sexual abuse to come forward, in the knowledge that they will be listened to and their allegations taken seriously.\" Friends and people who knew Lord Tonypandy have previously said they found the allegations difficult to believe."

Brazil's Joao Gomes Junior took silver and South African Cameron van der Burgh was third. \"I'm feeling very good. I'm so, so happy with my displays,\" Peaty said. He was speaking to the BBC after taking part in the 4x100m mixed medley relay final, in which defending champions Britain finished fifth. USA won in a world record time of three minutes 38.56 seconds. Australia took silver, with China and Canada in joint third. It was a different story in his individual race, earlier. Peaty was level with his rivals in the first few strokes before he pulled away after 30 metres. The City of Derby swimmer appeared set to break the world record for a third time in two days, but narrowly fell short. The Briton suggested \"equilibrium\" was key to his successes. \"I'm a massive believer that all areas of your life need to be equal for you to perform at your best,\" he added. \"Lifestyle, family and friendships. If one is out then you are not going to be at that level.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Van der Burgh, the 2009 and 2013 world champion in the 50m breaststroke, paid tribute to Peaty's powerful performances. \"I think I have to retire and give it a few years and come back when he's older,\" joked the 29-year-old. \"It's really impressive. It's not even breaststroke anymore, he's swimming like a new kind of stroke, like a metamorphosis between [butter]fly and breast. Former British swimmer Mark Foster told BBC Sport that Peaty's display was \"immense\". \"There not enough words to describe how good he is,\" he said. \"Under 26 seconds for the second time - only four hundredths of a second off his best time. It was, again, an immense swim.\" Karen Pickering, British 2001 world 4x200m freestyle gold medallist We all know how strong Peaty is. In his semi-final he was a little bit lower in the water as he set his world record. Because he's not quite as high as he is in the 100m, he has a quicker turnover. He can keep that up for 50m, but not for a 100m - that's why he went to 25.95 seconds. You couldn't do that in the 100m because of the build-up of lactic acid. But because it's Adam Peaty, he might be able to manage that in a year. Watch the full interview on BBC Radio 5 live's page Rebecca Adlington, double Olympic champion at Beijing 2008 He is the poster boy for swimming across the world, not just in Britain Adam gets the biggest cheer from the crowd for a non-Hungarian for the whole meet.

Doncaster believes the exciting drama of last season augurs well for the new campaign. \"After such an exciting end to last season: we had Aberdeen pushing Celtic close at the top and we had an incredible battle at the bottom of the Premiership with the top of the Championship in the play-offs; absolutely endorsing the decision the clubs made a couple of years ago to create them,\" he said. \"With Hearts returning to the top tier, you've still got Rangers and Hibernian in the Championship and I'm sure there'll be as much tension in the Championship this year as there was last. \"Who knows where Hearts will be this year? \"The league never gets to choose the clubs that appear at any level of the game. Last year was incredible to have Hearts, Hibernian and Rangers - three huge clubs - in the second tier. \"We welcome Hearts back this year and a lot of people will be looking to see how Robbie Neilson gets on.\" Doncaster also responded to reports that the SPFL has been inundated by complaints that all 10 in League Two clubs will be worse off as a result of corporate hospitality and advertising requirements in the ruling body's new \u00a32m sponsorship agreement with Ladbrokes. \"I read that I was inundated with complaints which seemed a bit hyperbolic,\" he said. \"I had two clubs who emailed me with some queries on the deal. There is a concern about the distribution model and the way in which the sponsorship revenue is divvied up. \"But the reality is that if you look at broadcasting revenue, that gets divvied up amongst all 42 clubs and League Two clubs don't put anything into that deal. \"So, I think it's a fair distribution model and has delivered more money for clubs than under the old split league system - with the SFL operating independently of the SPL - I think the vast majority of clubs are delighted with the way the merger has panned out and the way the SPFL is operating. \"The overall response I've had from the majority of clubs has been overwhelmingly positive.\""

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said \"two separate incidents\" involving three prisoners had been \"successfully resolved\" on Saturday.

The POA spokesman added this was \"another example of a failed benchmark process brought about by savage and unnecessary government cuts that has seen staffing levels decrease to an unsafe level\".

Currently some 1,200 members of the security forces are chasing the elusive gang leader. That is more than double the 500 who hunted Pablo Escobar, the drug lord who controlled the infamous cocaine cartel of the same name. Otoniel runs the Usuga clan, a drug gang that has its powerbase in the Uraba region of Colombia, but whose network extends across the country and beyond. Members of the gang have been arrested as far away as Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, Peru and Spain. The US Department of State describes it as a \"heavily armed, extremely violent criminal organisation\". It is offering up to $5m (\u00c2\u00a33.4m) for information leading to Otoniel's arrest. Otoniel has been in charge since his brother, Juan de Dios, was killed on 1 January 2012 when police raided his New Year's Eve party. The gang is first and foremost engaged in drug trafficking, but it has also been accused of extortion, illegal mining, forced disappearances and murder. It is very much a family business. Otoniel's partner, Blanca Senobia Madrid Benjumea, was in charge of the group's finances until her capture last month. His nephew, Harlison Usuga, looked after the drug traffic routes north to Central America and liaised with Mexican drug cartels until he, too, was captured in February. Over the past five years, the security forces have captured a whopping 6,700 members of the group. But its leader has evaded them so far. Last month, they launched a massive and costly operation to catch the elusive gang leader. Sources linked to the operation say $225,000 was spent on tracking down Otoniel in the first 25 days of the hunt. The people tasked with arresting him have been given clear orders from President Juan Manuel Santos and Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon: Do not leave Uraba until you have caught Otoniel and have dismantled the whole clan. So far, the security forces have seized 5.5 tonnes of cocaine, and destroyed a number of coca crops and laboratories that turn leaves into cocaine. But they have yet to find Otoniel. His uncanny ability to dodge the security forces is partly due to his family's close ties to the region. Otoniel was born in Uraba and knows the region like the back of his hand. Most importantly, through threats and intimidation he has gained almost total control over the local community. When he called on locals to down tools to mark his brother's death at the hand of the police, the region came to a standstill for several days. When people in the region hear Otoniel's name mentioned, they react with fear. It is hard for the security forces to gain people's trust here, and it is something they have not yet fully managed. Moreover, Otoniel uses a variety of tricks to evade the police. He has trained dogs to alert him to anyone approaching his hide-outs. Police recently managed to catch one of his guard dogs"

The test only runs for a few seconds, but it tells engineers that all nine engines at the base of the vehicle, and the sub-systems that support them, are functioning normally. If the test throws up no anomalies, the Falcon is given the green light to go ahead with its mission. Clearly, though, on this occasion, something went catastrophically wrong. The entire rocket and its satellite payload were destroyed in an explosion. Company CEO Elon Musk said the problem - whatever it was - occurred during the operation to fill the rocket with propellant, so the event happened just prior to the test ignition. Remarkably, the lightning towers surrounding the pad stayed standing in the face of the blast, and so did the erector tower that is used to feed cables and fluids to the rocket. Undoubtedly, though, Launch Complex 40 as it is known, will have suffered significant damage. Twisted and bent metal was visible to long-range cameras. But the repairs to the pad are only a part of SpaceX's immediate problems. Its launch schedule will now be put on hold, perhaps for many weeks, as engineers try to understand what happened and to correct any procedural errors and hardware failures. That is going to be a headache for SpaceX's many customers who are waiting patiently for a ride. The Amos-6 satellite that was lost in the explosion is just one spacecraft in a very long line of platforms that have contracts to fly on the Falcon. They have little option but to accept the delay; you cannot very easily swap rockets like you can swap trains. Most of the backlog is made up of commercial payloads, and every extra month these expensive satellites stay on the ground will hit their operators' revenues. Consider customers like Iridium - one of the main sat-phone providers. It was due to send up the first 10 spacecraft in its new constellation of satellites on a Falcon later this month. Iridium has big loans that need to be serviced. At Nasa, too, they will be frustrated. The agency sends cargo to the space station on Falcons, and the next freight mission was scheduled for November. More concerning however is the shadow this incident casts over the issue of human transportation. SpaceX has a contract to use its Falcon to take astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). Manned test flights were expected in the next 18 months. Is that timeline realistic now? This is the second accident involving a Falcon inside 15 months, after a vehicle broke up in flight in June 2015. The Falcon's performance will have reverberations with the US military also. SpaceX is working hard to convince the Pentagon that it has a reliable rocket system that can be entrusted with high-value national security missions. That job just got a little harder. Setbacks are inevitable in this business, however, and SpaceX has shown before that it can bounce back. Customers and commentators alike have"

Clergy representatives said they were unable to comment on the claims published in the Guardian as they formed part of an active investigation. The priest said all five men were aware of his claims he had been repeatedly raped by a vicar when he was 16 in 1984, but none of them acted. He said he made the allegations verbally to the Right Reverend Peter Burrows, the Bishop of Doncaster; the Right Reverend Steven Croft, the former Bishop of Sheffield, and now Bishop of Oxford; and the Right Reverend Martyn Snow, a former Archdeacon of Sheffield and Rotherham, and now the Bishop of Leicester, between July 2012 and February 2013. The Archbishop of York John Sentamu and the Right Reverend Glyn Webster, the Bishop of Beverley, were also made aware when they were copied in to a letter sent to the Rt Rev Croft in June 2013, he said. His lawyer, David Greenwood, of Switalskis Solicitors, said the priest finally spoke up after a safeguarding issue in his own parish \"triggered his memories\". \"He reached out for help to the Bishop of Doncaster but found that he got no help, no support and no response,\" he said. \"He continued to try to elicit a response from the senior people in his diocese but got nothing.\" Under the Church of England's clergy disciplinary measures a complaint must be made within one year of the alleged misconduct. An application for permission to make complaints out of time has been lodged and is being considered by the church. Mr Greenwood said a complaint had also been made to West Yorkshire Police and the details of the alleged misconduct passed to the Goddard Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse. A spokesperson for the archbishop said he had only been sent a copy of the letter and the original recipient of the letter had \"a duty to respond and not the archbishop\". A spokesperson for the bishops said that if the complaint went forward \"our bishops will make a full response to the various allegations made in due course\". A complaint has also been made by the priest against Roy Williamson, a former bishop of Bradford and now an honorary assistant bishop with the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham, that he failed to act at the time of the abuse. A spokesperson for his diocese said: \"We cannot comment during a live investigation except to say that if approached by the authorities we will offer them every co-operation.\" West Yorkshire Police said it is investigating a report of a historical serious sexual offence said to have occurred in the Bradford area in the 1980s. A force representative said: \"A crime has been recorded and a 69-year-old man has been spoken to in connection with the inquiry.\""

Today, the chain has 62 stores and employs approximately 800 people. Neil Gordon was born on 17 October 1952 in Newry, County Down. The son of a farmer, and one of five brothers, his interest in pharmacy was sparked at a young age. He was educated at Newry Model Primary school and Newry Grammar school before studying pharmacy at Bradford University. After a period of employment that included working in England, Neil established the first Gordons Chemists in Donaghadee in 1980. He was also a co-founder of the Donaghadee Comunity Workforce, assisting the long-term unemployed back into employment, while engaging in work of community benefit. He served as an elder at Shore Street Presbyterian Church, Donaghadee and was a trustee of the Lighthouse Trust, a charity serving children with cerebral palsy. Neil was elected to the executive committee of Belfast city centre management in 2004 and served until his death. He was elected to the board of the PCC (Pharmaceutical Contractors Committee), the committee responsible for negotiating community pharmacy services with the Department of Health, and served for seven years. He also served on the board of SOS Bus NI, a charity helping vulnerable people on the streets of Belfast. In 2013, Neil was awarded a Fellowship of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland.

His critics say he is trying to release allies convicted of corruption. They also want the proposals to be debated in parliament. Mr Grindeanu's plan is for the measures to be implemented through emergency decrees that bypass parliament and do not require the signature of President Klaus Iohannis. Those who would be due for release include several elected officials and magistrates convicted of corruption. President Iohannis joined protesters in Bucharest on Sunday, saying they were rightly indignant. \"Several political officials who have judicial issues want to change the legislation and weaken the rule of law,\" he said. \"It is unacceptable to modify the law so that the cases of dozens, even hundreds, of politicians, are wiped out.\" President Iohannis was elected in November 2014 and has vowed to stamp out entrenched corruption. However, the chairman of the ruling Social Democrats, Liviu Dragnea, accused the president of \"inciting social disorder and violence\" and said the protest was the start of a coup. A former minister, Mr Dragnea was himself given a suspended prison sentence in 2015 for using bribes and forged ballot papers to influence an impeachment vote in 2012 against then President Traian Basescu."

The Antonov An-12 plane was heading to Paloch, Upper Nile State, and crashed 800m (half a mile) from the runway. In a statement, Ukraine-based Antonov said the plane had not been airworthy. It said the plane, which was built in 1971, \"was is no state to fly because it failed to undergo timely technical servicing... that should have included work on extending its resources and exploitation timeframe\", AFP news agency reported. South Sudan authorities warned that the death toll could rise as the debris was cleared. The plane crashed into a farming community on an island on the White Nile River but so far all the victims recovered were from the aircraft, the Red Cross said. Presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny said all of the plane's passengers were from South Sudan. He said five of the six crew members were Armenian, while the sixth member was Russian. Armenia's foreign ministry has confirmed that five of its nationals were killed. The head of the Civil Aviation at Juba airport said emergency officials had secured the site of the crash and were \"in the stage of recovering bodies and black box [flight recorder]\". While the cause of the crash is still unclear, the presidential spokesman told a news conference that it might have been down to engine failure. Witnesses said bodies, debris and cargo were strewn over a wide area along the river bank. A man who saw the plane come down said he thought it might crash into a market area, but the pilot seemed to divert at the last minute. A local farmer described the moment the plane started to go down, telling AFP: \"The sound was so loud... the plane started descending and landed near my door. \"One of the tyres broke off and ran into the house - but thank God it did not injure anyone.\" Cargo planes flying to remote parts of South Sudan often carry passengers too. The plane's first flight was in 1971, the Aviation Safety Network reported. It was being operated by Allied Services Limited, a logistics company based in South Sudan, at the time of the crash. However, the plane belonged to the Tajik company Asia Airways, Tajikistan's Transport Ministry told the Ozodagon news agency."

      "text": "Steel workers at Port Talbot have expressed concerns over the agreement between the company and unions to accept a less generous pension in return for future investment on site. Unions will not make a recommendation to their members on whether to accept or reject the proposal. Tata is consulting staff on moving to the new scheme, calling it essential. It has launched a series of \"roadshows\" for staff to explain what moving from the current final salary pensions will mean for them. The new defined contribution scheme will see 10% paid in by the business and 6% by the employees. Although this is not as generous as current provisions, experts say it is better than many other company schemes. The unions believe the company is responsible for explaining to workers why it thinks the changes are necessary. They say they will not ballot members until Tata has explained all the details. Tata has made it clear the changes are required in order for it to commit to a new package at Port Talbot, including investing \u00c2\u00a31bn over 10 years. There is also a guarantee to keep operating two blast furnaces at the site for five years and to try to avoid compulsory redundancies over the same period. Any extra investment from Tata is also linked to improved productivity and savings at Port Talbot. It is understood many workers are angry the pension proposals are back on the table after Tata was forced to back down from similar plans 18 months ago when unions threatened strike action. There has also been criticism over a lack of detailed information from the company. Steel worker David Edwards, who has worked at the Port Talbot plant for 11 years, said the general mood among workers was \"pretty depressing\". \"The more we seem to be hearing, the more fine print then, it doesn't seem to be as good a deal as it originally sounded like,\" he said. \"The pensions have already been attacked, people have been pushed from working from 60 until 65... now they're coming for the pension again. \"It just seems to be one thing after the other.\" He added: \"People are worried for their future.\" Aberavon councillor Tony Taylor said some workers felt \"railroaded\" by the deal. But he added: \"I think this is the only game in town to be honest and it's given a lifeline of five, seven, 10 years. \"At least it's giving secure long-term jobs and it's going to be a stable industry for that time.\" The steelworkers union, Community, has said there is no better deal on the table from the company. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies called on the first minister to work with Tata and unions and use his influence to help sell the deal to the workforce. Mr Davies said: \"Given that the first minister last week gave his unequivocal backing for the Tata deal in the Assembly chamber, it is now incumbent on him to work with the company and the unions to help sell the deal to the workforce.\""

The hubbub around the door and signs in the window handwritten in Arabic script indicate that arrivals from the Middle East are still coming to Serbia's capital. Inside, there is organised chaos. On the ground floor, young men lounge awkwardly in hard-backed chairs, waiting for their turn on the computers lined up on one side of the room. Those in front of the machines don headsets and hold ebullient Skype conversations. Upstairs, the atmosphere is completely different. Bewildered-looking families gather in a stuffy \"safe space\" operated by Save The Children. Parents usher their children over to a pile of toys, while a small boy cries inconsolably. The distinctive aroma of the refugee trail - damp, unwashed clothes - begins to fill the room. \"They are Yazidi people from Iraq,\" says Marjan, a translator struggling to find a common language with the new arrivals. There are more than two dozen people in this extended family group. They did not follow the classic route to Serbia via Greece and Macedonia, but came over the country's eastern border with Bulgaria. In the centre's strip-lighted, windowless meeting room, the overflowing ashtrays and half-drunk mugs of Turkish coffee suggest that it has been a stressful morning. The centre's manager, Vladimir Sjekloca, breaks off to explain the situation. \"There are always people in Belgrade,\" he says. \"Around 400-500 a day.\" Vladimir says the increasing restrictions imposed by countries along the Balkan route - and finally its official closure (although hundreds of people have found a way through the border fence to cross from Greece into Macedonia) - have not stopped people seeking a way to western Europe. They have just changed the means. \"Coming in through Bulgaria - it's an old smuggling route and it'll be used more often. The Afghans tell us, 'It's cheaper to come that way [than the sea crossing from Turkey to Greece] and anyway we can't swim.'\" Before its closure, countries along the route had been co-ordinating transport so that people would be taken from Macedonia to Slovenia's border with Austria on officially provided trains and buses. It was a reasonably smooth process which greatly reduced the possibility of refugees falling into the hands of people smugglers. But now people who are desperate or determined to reach western Europe are once again dealing with unscrupulous elements. \"The journey through Bulgaria is full of ill-treatment,\" says Vladimir. \"People suffer at the hands of the mafia and people smugglers - and they don't get protection from the system. In fact, they can get ill-treated by the Bulgarian police or put in jail. They have set dogs on refugees - we've seen people with dog bites who've been severely beaten by the mafia or the police.\" Some of the people at the Asylum Information Centre have learned the hard way that people smugglers and even the authorities may not have their best interests at heart.

Sensing he was \"seriously traumatised\", the Queen asked if she could help before calling for her corgis. He told Desert Island Discs the dogs had a therapeutic effect. The surgeon, who volunteers with Medecins Sans Frontieres and the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the Queen's humanity was \"unbelievable\" and described her as \"warm and wonderful\". Dr Nott told the BBC Radio 4 programme that he had been operating on \"badly damaged\" children from a makeshift theatre in the Syrian city and key battleground of Aleppo, and he did not know what to say to the Queen when it was his turn to speak. For more than two decades, Dr Nott - a consultant surgeon at Royal Marsden, St Mary's and Chelsea and Westminster Hospitals in London - has given up several months every year to volunteer in war zones and amid major humanitarian crises. He has performed life-saving surgery in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan and Syria. During Desert Island Discs he recalled meeting the Queen at a private lunch at Buckingham Palace in October 2014. Dr Nott - who admitted that he suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of his work in war zones - said: \"I [had been] coping [in Syria] with children that were really badly damaged and she must have detected something significant. \"I didn't know what to say. It wasn't that I didn't want to speak to her - I just couldn't. I just could not say anything. \"She picked all this up and said, 'Well, shall I help you?' I thought, 'How on earth can the Queen help me?' \"All of a sudden the courtiers brought the corgis and the corgis went underneath the table.\" Dr Nott said the Queen then opened a tin of biscuits and invited him to feed and stroke the dogs. He added: \"And so for 20 minutes during this lunch the Queen and I fed the dogs. She did it because she knew that I was so seriously traumatised. You know the humanity of what she was doing was unbelievable.\" During the programme, Dr Nott also recalled the moment when he was operating on a man and six armed militants from so-called Islamic State (IS) burst into the room. Dr Nott said he was too scared to speak for fear that the militants would recognise he was British. \"I remember so vividly my legs shaking like jelly, and they stayed in for about 20 minutes with their guns all pointing towards us, then all of a sudden something happened outside... and they left,\" he said. Earlier this year, Dr Nott was named winner of the Robert Burns Humanitarian Award 2016. He also set up the David Nott Foundation which offers other surgeons and medical professionals training and advice on how to help in conflict and natural disaster zones around the world."

However, said Colby Moore from security firm Synack, the way it passes data around is \"fundamentally broken\" making it vulnerable to attack. Globalstar has not yet issued any comment on Mr Moore's findings. Mr Moore said the problems with Globalstar's network arise because it does not encrypt the data passing between devices and satellites. Instead, he said, the system attempts to conceal what it does by changing frequencies and padding transmissions with useless data. The system also does not check that data was coming from where it claimed, he said. \"I ended up figuring out how to decode the data in transit,\" Mr Moore told Reuters, adding that it might prove hard to fix the flaws as existing hardware was not easy to update. Globalstar has been told about the flaws, he added, but so far has not issued any updates or fixes. Attackers can easily find out these flaws, he said, making it easy to spoof data or keep an eye on assets being tracked. Organised crime gangs, police and intelligence agencies might already be listening in, he said. Mr Moore is planning to release more details about his work at the Black Hat hacker conference in Las Vegas next week. This month has seen the early release of other investigations into the security of cars and Android phones that will also feature at Black Hat. Earlier this week, security experts from Zimpherium released some information about a vulnerability that affected almost one billion Android handsets. Google has produced a patch for the bug but many handsets have yet to have it applied. Last week, in separate demonstrations, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek from security firm IOActive and Andy Davis from the UK's NCC Group showed how it was possible to attack some makes of car via their entertainment systems. The IOActive work led car maker Chrysler to issue a recall of more than 1.4 million vehicles to patch the software hole."

It has its own heartbeat. Oftentimes, it's rugby in the trenches. Full Metal Jacket stuff. It's not as easy on the eye as the New Zealands and the Australias, but it works. And fans adore it. In the southern hemisphere's four-nation tournament, yes, there are more tries, but does that necessarily make it better, more intoxicating? Across a difficult four-year period in economic terms, Six Nations crowds have gone from an average of 69,531 to 68,968, a drop of less than 1%. That's good going in the climate. The Rugby Championship's crowds are down close to 12%. The opposing, pro-change view is that the Six Nations has become a bit tired and is in need of modernising. The Rugby Championship, the Champions Cup, the Premiership in England, the Pro12, the Top 14 in France and Super Rugby in the southern hemisphere all have the bonus-point system. In the Six Nations there is a view that the premium is on defence over attack. That argument can be overblown, but there's truth in it, too. Those who are supportive of the new bonus-point system see a vision of the future that will have a nation busting a gut to turn three tries into four in the latter stages of a Test, just to secure that extra point. Cue more attacking intent and more entertainment. That's the wish. For example, in the 2015 Six Nations, had England scored four tries against Scotland - and got a bonus point - instead of three they might have won the championship. The winners, Ireland, could apply the same logic to one of their games, of course. So could Wales. In 2014, had England added to their two first-half tries in their victory against Wales with another two in the second half"

A law to change the name is expected to pass before the 2021 election. Presiding Officer Elin Jones hoped people would \"more fully understand the powers of the assembly and the role it plays in their lives\". But Neil Hamilton, UKIP AM, expressed concerns over potential costs. The assembly was given the power to rename itself under the 2017 Wales Act. Assembly members had unanimously backed the idea last July after which it was put out to public consultation. Publishing the responses on Tuesday, Ms Jones said: \"Our role today is as a full parliamentary body, with the power to pass laws and agree taxes, and we must continue to work hard to inspire the confidence, trust and pride in the people we serve.\" Speaking to BBC Wales, Ms Jones said the Welsh Parliament name will \"reflect directly the will of the people of Wales in giving us the mandate to have the powers to create legislation on their behalf\". \"We are a parliament in all but name,\" she said. Sixty percent of people responding to the consultation said they did not agree that the role of the assembly was well understood. Just over a fifth of respondents - 22.6% - who responded to the survey said they strongly disagreed or disagreed with the assembly's name changing. Legislation on assembly reforms - including the change of name - will be published by the Assembly Commission in 2018. They will include rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of the committee system. The commission proposes that assembly members will in future be known as Welsh Parliament Members (WPMs), in keeping with the current title of Assembly Members. The option was the second least-favoured option according to a summary of the survey conducted for the consultation - with 11.1% of respondents preferring it over other suggestions. Member of the Welsh Parliament was preferred by 30% while 28.4% liked Member of the Senedd. Tory AM Suzy Davies, Assembly Commissioner with responsibility for budget and governance, said the assembly would not \"waste resources by rushing to make the change\", noting that some people responding to the consultation were worried about the cost. She said until legislation is passed the institution will continue to be known by its current name in order to avoid confusion and to minimise cost. There have long been calls to call the assembly a Welsh Parliament, with Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies having made the suggestion in 2012. On Tuesday, Mr Davies said: \"The assembly has clearly evolved into a parliament, and it's only right that this is now reflected in its name.\" First Minister Carwyn Jones said: \"The name Welsh Parliament / Senedd Wales will help to enhance understanding of the assembly and reflect its status as a national parliament, on a par with the other legislatures in the UK.\" Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood also welcomed the name change, saying the assembly's stature and confidence"

Accused of procuring an act of \"gross indecency\" likely to cause offence for his production of The Romans in Britain at London's National Theatre, Bogdanov says he felt \"enormous relief\" when the case collapsed and the prosecution withdrew its evidence on the third day of the hearing. He also says he felt \"very angry\" that the private prosecution brought by the morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse had been allowed to happen at all. Mrs Whitehouse, he says, \"confused reality with an illusion\" on the stage. If he had been convicted, Bogdanov could have been jailed for up to three years. Written by the playwright Howard Brenton, The Romans in Britain, which opened in London in October 1980, was always likely to provoke controversy. With vivid imagery, strong language and violence, the play sought to draw graphic parallels between the Romans' invasion of the British Isles and the presence at the time of British soldiers on the streets of Northern Ireland. But it was one short scene involving the attempted rape of a young Druid called Marban by a Roman soldier (\"a metaphor for the rape of one culture by another,\" according to the director), that eventually landed Bogdanov in court. When he was first handed the play by the National's then artistic director, Sir Peter Hall, Bogdanov says he thought it contained some of the best new writing he had read. The attempted rape scene, to be performed with naked actors in full light and centre-stage, was \"brilliantly written\". But though nudity was not uncommon on the stage - and Bogdanov was careful that no sexual contact was actually made between the actors (the Roman used his bunched up fist and thumb as a substitute for his erect penis) - Sir Peter was clearly worried. He asked Bogdanov to consider moving the scene upstage, in half light. The director stood his ground, arguing the scene's artistic merit. Sir Peter eventually acceded, but not before warning that there could be trouble ahead. Though playing to packed audiences, the play's nudity and strong language attracted fervent media attention. But more ominously, it quickly came to the notice of Mrs Whitehouse, then head of the National Viewers and Listeners' Association. She refused to attend a performance in person but in December 1980 sent her solicitor to watch the play in order to collect evidence. He came back convinced there had been a sexual act on stage likely to cause offence. Listen to the programme Download the podcast Having tried and failed to force the Attorney General to initiate a prosecution against the National, the morality campaigner then began her own proceedings under the 1956 Sexual Offences Act, accusing Bogdanov of being the \"pimp\" who had allegedly procured the act on stage. Three decades on, Bogdanov's memories of those days are still vivid. He and his colleagues had initially dismissed the"

But under new European regulations, supported by Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA), they will have to rely on visual checks alone. The FSA says the new system avoids the risk of harmful bacteria being spread. Around eight million pigs a year are slaughtered for meat in the UK. Ron Spellman, a British meat inspector with 30 years' experience, says the new regulations, which took effect from 1 June, risk diseased parts of animals going undetected. Listen to Allan Urry's report on File on Four on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 BST on Tuesday 17 June, or catch up on the BBC iPlayer Mr Spellman, who is director general of the European Working community for Food inspectors and Consumer protection (EWFC), which represents meat inspectors across the EU, said: \"Last year we know that there were at least 37,000 pigs' heads with abscesses or tuberculosis lesions in lymph nodes in the head. They won't be cut now. \"There's no way to see those little abscesses, little tuberculosis lesions without cutting those lymph nodes.\" Meat from pigs' heads, is recovered by specialised parts of boning plants and goes into pies, sausages and other processed foods. The new regulations have been drawn up by the European Food Safety Authority, an agency funded by the EU, but they are based on scientific advice from the FSA. The FSA's chief operating officer Andrew Rhodes told the BBC it was better to have a hands-off system using visual checks to reduce cross-contamination, because bugs like E. coli and campylobacter are causing scientists more concern. He said: \"The risks to the consumers are increasingly from microbiological and pathogenic hazards and that's what we must control. \"We cannot simply ignore the risks that are brought by touching, cutting and handling products that are later going to go on to be cooked and eaten, we have to do this properly.\" But the FSA's support for the new measures puts them at odds with many of their own frontline staff, the 1,100 meat inspectors who check safety standards in Britain's 350 slaughterhouses and in meat-cutting plants which process carcasses. Some in the slaughtering industry are also opposing the changes. Kevin Burrows, of C and K Meats, owns an abattoir in Suffolk whose main business is pork. He sees the new hands-off approach as \"a backward step\" and says his customers in Asian markets still insist on their pork being checked in the old way, which the FSA has agreed to allow him to do. But he says: \"Why should an exported product be under higher scrutiny than a British product? We'll end up with a two-tier system.\" Shadow food and farming minister Huw Irranca-Davies has called for an urgent meeting with the FSA. He says he is not convinced by the science he has seen on the matter and is worried the new rules could damage Britain's exports, which rely on a reputation for high welfare and meat hygiene standards.

Hearts said on their website: \"We are absolutely delighted that the foundation members have given such a resounding vote in favour of the offer from Ann Budge. \"This significant milestone on the road to the 'new' Tynecastle once more demonstrates our collective strength.\" Hearts hope to fund the new stand via \u00a33m from club reserves, \u00a32.5m from benefactor contributions, \u00a30.5m from commercial contributions, which leaves a shortfall of \u00a36m once the club adds a contingency for an increase in costs. The Scottish Premiership club hope to build up further reserves and launch a new debenture scheme, but the delay of up to two years in the Foundation of Hearts buying Budge's stake will allow funds to go directly into the club in the meantime. \"Assuming contributions continued at today's levels, majority ownership would pass to FOH only eight months later than originally envisaged,\" Hearts have stated. Full planning permission is still required from City of Edinburgh Council, but Hearts have already planned out the progress of the two-year project that will result in a stadium with a capacity up to 21,000.

Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. \"Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,\" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from \"policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government\", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year.

She said she hoped to name a new candidate \"within a reasonable amount of time\" but said whoever was approached would need to \"think carefully\" about the nature of the role. Keith Vaz, chairman of the committee, which is also investigating historical child sex abuse, said the handling of the issue had been \"somewhat shambolic\" and raised issues about Mrs May's judgement. In a statement, Lady Butler-Sloss said she had been \"honoured\" to be asked to chair the inquiry and had hoped to \"make a useful contribution\". But, she added: \"It has become apparent over the last few days, however, that there is a widespread perception, particularly among victim and survivor groups, that I am not the right person to chair the inquiry. \"It has also become clear to me that I did not sufficiently consider whether my background and the fact my brother had been attorney general would cause difficulties. \"This is a victim-orientated inquiry and those who wish to be heard must have confidence that the members of the panel will pay proper regard to their concerns and give appropriate advice to government. \"Having listened to the concerns of victim and survivor groups and the criticisms of MPs and the media, I have come to the conclusion that I should not chair this inquiry and have so informed the Home Secretary.\" The inquiry was set up to examine how state institutions handled their duty of care to protect children from paedophiles. What next? By BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Most public bodies at least claim they appoint people because of what they know, not who they know. But it was Lady Butler-Sloss's family and political connections - not her experience and knowledge - which led to her resignation. There will be no rush to appoint her successor - it could take several days. That's because while her resignation was unfortunate, a second controversial appointment"

Deradicalisation classes will be made mandatory for others deemed a threat. But Muslim leaders warned the strategy \"continues down a flawed path\" and risks \"alienating\" Muslims in the UK. Also among the measures within the counter-extremism strategy are: Prime Minister David Cameron said the plan would work because it was \"comprehensive\" . \"It's no good leaving this simply to the police or the intelligence services. It's no good simply talking about violent extremism. We need to confront all extremism,\" he said. He said its effectiveness would be measured by whether people were being turned away from extremism, stopped from travelling to fight for IS, and by having \"more cohesive and integrated communities\". Home Secretary Theresa May said non-violent extremism could not go \"uncontested\" as it led to the erosion of women's rights, the spread of intolerance and bigotry and the separation of some communities \"from the mainstream\". She said that applied to neo-Nazi extremism just as much as Islamist doctrine. The Muslim Council of Britain has released a highly-critical statement in response to the plans. Secretary general Dr Shuja Shafi said the strategy would \"reinforce perceptions that all aspects of Muslim life must undergo a 'compliance' test to prove our loyalty to this country\". \"These measures could be seen more as a means to address the anxieties a minority of people may have against Muslims and their religious life, rather than the scourge of terrorism itself,\" he said. Dr Shafi also said he detected \"McCarthyist undertones\" in the plans to create blacklists and exclude and ban people those deemed to be extremists. Mr Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said the announcement was a \"missed opportunity to really engage the Muslim community\". But Fiyaz Mughal, director of the interfaith Faith Matters organisation, said there was much in the plans that could \"help in the battle against those who promote extremism\". Robin Brant, BBC political correspondent At the heart of this considerable strategy on counter extremism are two significant challenges for the prime minister: the internet and the law. Getting inciteful content off the web and getting \"counter narrative\" content up there is key to harnessing the full potential of a medium that IS has already mastered. There has been much focus on the mosques but bedroom radicalisation is something the prime minister and MI5 worry intensely about. The process of trying to persuade Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants to help is ongoing. On the second point, the plans to introduce new powers to restrict what extremists can do and where they can go are still in their legal infancy. The government concedes they will need to be properly targeted. It is still consulting with lawyers and community groups to try to get the balance right. Police estimate at least 700 people from the UK have travelled to support or fight for jihadist organisations in Syria and Iraq, such as the so-called Islamic State, and the"

      "text": "The Australian impresario's death was confirmed on Facebook by Spencer Gibb, son of Bee Gees star Robin Gibb. A cause of death was not immediately available. Andrew Lloyd Webber was among those paying tribute, describing Stigwood as a \"great showman\" who \"taught me much\". Spencer Gibb called him \"a creative genius with a very quick and dry wit\" adding that \"Robert was the driving force behind The Bee Gees career\". Stigwood started out as an advertising agency copywriter in his native Australia before moving to the UK at the age of 21 There, he made his name representing English singer John Leyton, securing him a role on the TV show Harpers West One. The deal allowed Leyton to perform a song - Johnny Remember Me - which spent four weeks at number one in 1961. By 1966, after a period of bankruptcy, he became a booking agent for The Who, luring them onto his own Reaction Records label, where they recorded the hit single Substitute. He went on to manage Cream and Eric Clapton, before signing the Bee Gees in 1967 and steering them to international success with an intensive promotional campaign for the single New York Mining Disaster 1941. By the early 1970s, though, the Bee Gees had fallen out of favour, and Clapton was inactive due to drug addiction. Stigwood turned his attention to musicals, producing the movie version of Jesus Christ Superstar and The Who's rock opera Tommy. Having bought the management rights to Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar, Stigwood was instrumental in cracking down on unlicensed performances of the musicals in the US - including school productions - to ensure profits went into pockets of its creators. He also formed RSO Records (short for Robert Stigwood Organization), where he resuscitated the careers of his two biggest acts - sending Clapton to the top of the charts with I Shot The Sheriff, and rebranding the Bee Gees as falsetto-voiced disco lynchpins on Jive Talking. The Australian's midas touch continued in the late 1970s, when he produced Saturday Night Fever, making a global star of television actor John Travolta and selling 40 million copies of the Bee Gees-powered soundtrack. Stigwood followed it with the evergreen teen musical Grease, and was particularly proud of casting fellow Australian Olivia Newton John in the role of Sandy. But he faltered with the 1978 Beatles musical Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - a fantastical but unfocused movie starring The Bee Gees, Peter Frampton and comedian Frankie Howerd. \"If you like the Beatles and you like movies, do yourself a favour and stay away,\" wrote influential US film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum. Audiences took note, and the film flopped at the box office, although the soundtrack sold well. Stigwood went on to produce the similarly-disappointing sequels Grease 2 and Staying Alive - but found success later in life with the Madonna-starring musical Evita, which won the 1997 Golden Globe for best film. The movie's lyricist, Sir Tim Rice, paid tribute to Stigwood on Twitter, calling him \"extraordinary, innovative [and] generous\". \"[He was] a vital part"

      "text": "The Scottish government is to change the law to make sure children spend a minimum of 25 hours a week in class. It follows rows over attempts by some councils to reduce the length of the school week to help balance their books. Nobody in the mainstream has seriously argued that a cut in the school week would actually help improve children's attainment. Councils which have looked at the idea would argue they have done so out of financial necessity. Their argument has, essentially, been that a cut in the school week for some is a \"least worst option\". When West Dunbartonshire advanced the idea earlier this year, they argued that the cut would affect things such as assemblies and \"golden time\" - not actual teaching time in the classroom. The savings come, for instance, by reducing the number of hours when the building itself is open. Parents have often reacted angrily to the proposals though. Quite apart from any concern they may have about their children's education suffering, some would face practical problems with childcare. With local government funding tight, the problem comes with the amount of flexibility councils have to find the best ways to balance their books. Education in Scotland is, essentially, a national service which councils are entrusted to deliver. There are many nationally set rules and guidelines. For instance, teachers' pay and conditions are standardised across Scotland and there are already minimum requirements on the number of days when schools have to be opened. Councils get the bulk of their money from the Scottish government and the latest funding deal commits councils to maintaining the number of teachers - even though some had argued that was not necessarily the best use of their resources. Councils are under a legal obligation to balance their books. If one potential option for savings is closed, inevitably, it could lead to greater pressure on another service. Local government organisation Cosla is also angry about the government's announcement, claiming there had been a lack of consultation. Some in local government argue councils need greater financial freedom to be able to properly respond to local needs. They see the current financial settlement as something of a straightjacket because they have little real control over the overall size of their budget. A report in the next few weeks by a commission set up by the Scottish government and Cosla will outline various alternatives to the council tax - the tax which typically raises around 15p of every pound councils spend. In some council chambers, there will be disappointment if the debate is not widened to also look at whether councils should be less dependent on central government for cash and have more options on how to raise money locally."

He is believed to have been originally known as Ronald Fiddler. Fiddler, 50 and from Manchester, was sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2002. IS has now published a photograph of Fiddler, who was also known as Jamul-Uddin al-Harith before taking the nom-du-guerre Abu-Zakariya al-Britani. He had been seized by US forces in Pakistan in 2001, before being sent to Guantanamo. US interrogators found he provided useful information to them about the Taliban's methods, and he was released after two years. The Daily Mail reported Fiddler received a million pounds in compensation from the government when he came back to the UK. The BBC has seen IS registration papers signed by Fiddler in April 2014 when he crossed into Syria from Turkey. He volunteered to be a fighter, saying his knowledge of Islam was basic. His wife told the Daily Mirror that she and their five children went to Syria try to persuade him to come back, but failed, and they ended up having to flee for their lives from IS territory. Afzal Ashraf, a former counter-terrorism adviser to the United States in Iraq, told the BBC this incident demonstrated that \"some of the people in Guantanamo Bay were up to no good\". \"It also throws into question some of the organisations that were supporting him, that brought him back [from Guantanamo]. \"Some of them were associated a little too closely with this radical ideology, and they use the legal system - freedoms of speech, the importance of the rule of law - in order to subvert some of our systems in the UK and elsewhere.\" BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the \"pipeline\" of British and European jihadists who once crossed the Turkish border into Syria, into IS-controlled territory, has now \"pretty much dried up\". He added: \"Guantanamo Bay was incredibly bad in the ideological fight against extremism. It makes it very difficult for America, Britain and other countries whose nationals are there to maintain any kind of moral high ground, because they [detainees] were imprisoned without trial. \"And what do you do about the estimated 400 British jihadists who are still out there? If they don't die on the battlefield, are they going to try and come back? How do you monitor them? Do you believe the people who say 'I've turned my back on all of that'. \"Most people will probably want to do exactly that. Some, though, may have other ideas.\" According to figures published by the UK government last year, about 850 people regarded as a national security concern have gone to become fighters in the Middle East. Of those, just under half have returned to the UK and approximately 15% are dead. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, and against all travel to large parts of Iraq. \"As all UK consular services are suspended in Syria and greatly limited"

The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: \"A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. \"Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. \"A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do.\" Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: \"For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally. \"Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region.\" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a \"tiny and insignificant group\". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room. Later that month, she said she had acted \"with propriety\" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post. Meanwhile, UKIP's NEC confirmed that 11 hopefuls in the contest to succeed Paul Nuttall as leader will be able to run as candidates. The list includes Anne Marie Waters, the founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group, who has described Islam as evil. UKIP AM David Rowlands had said Ms Waters is probably \"too extreme\" to be allowed to stand but she claimed the party was trying to \"ostracise\" her. Other candidates who have also cleared the NEC's vetting process and are going forward to a vote of the membership include Welsh activist John Rees-Evans, London Assembly member Peter Whittle and Scottish MEP David Coburn. Mr Nuttall resigned after the general election in June when the party failed to win any seats and saw its vote plummet."

      "text": "French striker Moussa Dembele, 20, has made an instant impact this season with 12 goals for the Scottish champions. But the latest Dembele - no relation - came on for the final nine minutes of Celtic Under-20s' win against Hearts. He replaced Jack Aitchison, 16, who became Celtic's youngest-ever player in the final game of last season. Aitchison scored with his first touch after coming on as a substitute aged 16 years and 71 days in their 7-0 rout of Motherwell in May. But Ivorian Dembele could challenge that record after appearing for the club's reserve team, which is seven years above his age group. Dembele went viral with a series of tricks playing for Celtic's U13s at the St Kevin's Boys Academy Cup tournament in Dublin this summer. Celtic's website said Dembele \"didn't look out of place\" after being given his chance on Monday at Greenock Morton's Cappielow ground, with six of their usual squad away on Scotland U19s duty. The 15-year-old Kieran McGrath also played. Celtic's head of youth, Chris McCart, added: \"We were all delighted to see Karamoko make his debut for the development squad against Hearts in what proved to be an entertaining game. \"The fact that he was playing against other players seven years his senior gives an indication of the quality this young boy possesses and it was also fitting that he came on for Jack Aitchison, the club's youngest-ever goalscorer. \"What we need to remember, though, is that Karamoko is just 13 years old. He was given a chance to play last night on merit, as was Kieran, but it is very important that we continue their development at a measured pace. \"Karamoko is still a young boy and has a lot of growing to do, both physically and mentally. \"The coaches at our under-13 and 14 levels have been fantastic in nurturing his potential, but it is crucial that we do not push him too far, too soon. \"He has a lot of hard work ahead of him to make it to the top and we won't rush that, but we also know Karamoko, and the other talented young players we have here, is at the perfect place to continue his progress and we look forward to seeing what the future holds for this young player.\""

Some of the promises are not yet formalised and environmentalists say the measures proposed are not nearly urgent enough. But UN officials praised the statement. Meeting in New York, they said it was part of a clear international shift against ocean pollution. Eric Solheim, the UN's environment director, told BBC News: \"There are quite encouraging signs, with nations taking the ocean much more seriously. Of course, there is a very long way to go because the problems are huge.\" It is estimated that 5-13 million tonnes of plastics flow into the world's oceans annually. Much of it is ingested by birds and fish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and fragments of plastic have even been found in organisms at the bottom of the ocean. A recent paper said much of the marine plastic often originates far from the sea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially in countries which have developed consumer economies faster than their ability to manage waste. The Helmholtz Centre in Leipzig, Germany, estimated that 75% of land-borne marine pollution comes from just 10 rivers, predominantly in Asia. Reducing the plastic loads in these rivers by 50% would reduce global plastic inputs by 37%, it said. Tom Dillon from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which campaign on oceans, urged China to move quickly. He told BBC News: \"For thousands of years the Maritime Silk Road was a pathway for export of Chinese culture and influence. Will the ocean be a vehicle for export of Chinese pollution, or a new culture of conservation and sustainability?\" A report to the UN conference from the Thailand government says most marine plastic debris is land-based, caused by inefficient waste management and poor handling of plastic wastes. In Thailand, the total amount of garbage finding its way into the sea was estimated at 2.83 million tonnes in 2016 - of which 12% was plastic. The Thai government says the nation has established a 20-year strategy to tackle the problem, including developing financial incentives for keeping plastic out of the sea and encouraging eco-packaging design and eco-friendly substitutes for plastics. In Indonesia, the government is starting a mass education programme for schoolchildren, and in the Philippines new laws are being developed. Part of the challenge is finding substitutes for plastics. An international prize for smarter materials and design for packaging was launched recently by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

      "text": "Under a longstanding agreement with the city of New York, the museum must accept whatever patrons offer to pay. But signs at cashier desks appear to demand full price, the suit contends. The museum says its \"recommended\" policy has been place for 40 years and it makes no effort to deceive visitors. The lawsuit, filed in New York City on behalf of former patrons, contends that the world famous museum, which receives six million visitors a year, uses misleading marketing and cashier training to deceive unwary visitors. Lawyers say the signs in the lobby listing the price of admission with the word \"recommended\" below in smaller type violate a 1893 law mandating the public be admitted free of charge at least five days and two evenings per week in exchange for monetary grants and rent-free use of city-owned land. The suit, which lawyers hope will eventually represent a broad class of people who have visited the museum in recent years, seeks a change in the admissions policy and reimbursement for those who they say were misled. Confusion over whether visitors were required to pay the full $25 is \"an issue with tourists travelling to the US from a foreign country\", Michael Hiller, a lawyer for those who brought the suit, told the BBC. \"They are violating the statute, plainly and simply,\" Mr Hiller said, referring to the 1893 law. \"The museum was designed to make art accessible to the public.\" A former employee of the Met is expected to testify, Mr Hiller said. The witness, who trained cashiers from 2007-2011, alleges that signage was changed from \"suggested\" to \"recommended\" because administrators believed it would encourage people to pay more, Mr Hiller said. Harold Holzer, a spokesman for the museum, said the 1893 law had been superseded. New York City agreed to the museum's request in 1970 to charge an admission fee - so long as the amount was left up to individuals and the signage reflected that. About 40% of visitors pay full price, Mr Holzer said. He said gate proceeds allowed the Met to offer free admission to special exhibitions. About 11% of the museum's operating expenses were covered by admissions last year. As a non-profit organisation, the museum pays no income taxes. It is one of the wealthiest museums in the world, with a $2bn investment portfolio. Mr Holzer estimated the museum would receive 15-20% of its operating budget from the fees this year, with 11% coming from city grants. The Met believes its policy \"guarantees access for people regardless of their ability to pay\", Mr Holzer said. He noted other New York City museums charge steep admission fees. Entrance fees for prominent New York City art museums such as the Whitney, the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim range from $18 to $25. Mr Hiller demands the museum stop charging entirely for admission and remove the cashier desks. \"You have got to eliminate any effort to charge people,\" he said."

Adam Scorer was speaking after it emerged that the Grenfell Tower fire started in a Hotpoint fridge-freezer. Some 79 people are feared dead. He told 5 Live's Wake Up to Money that while councils were responsible for trading standards, there was no central system to relay information about products to the public. \"Consumers should be confident that most products are safe, but we do know that the regime is as strong as its weakest link,\" Mr Scorer said. \"We don't have a central organisation of technical resources, we don't have core funding where we can be sure of who is going to be around to do this testing, and we don't have the right level of strategic communication to make sure that risks are placed on the system, flags are alerted and people are able to go in and do the right level of investigation of all the products that are concerned.\" Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable told the programme that trading standards were a problem area because they were not a statutory obligation of local government. \"There are some things local government is required to do - trading standards not so,\" he said. \"So when local councils are under financial pressure it is something they can cut back on.\" Although the Department of Business provides \u00c2\u00a315m annually for national trading standards activities, the vast majority of services are funded by local authorities. The departments were once known as Weights and Measures. Sir Vince suggested imposing an obligation on local authorities to strengthen trading standards, adding: \"Or you could give them some financial support, which I think is what we should be probably doing, to have some ring-fenced money that supports what is currently a declining service.\" He was Business Secretary when former BBC presenter Lynn Faulds-Wood was commissioned to investigate product safety. She claims the government ignored her report. \"I think Lynn Faulds-Wood's concern is she made recommendations that were very modest and did not entail public cost, [but] even they have not been acted on and that was where she is enormously frustrated.\" Sir Vince added: \"There is a tendency at the moment to look at whether the costs are to business rather than whether the costs are to society as a whole.\" A Department for Business spokesperson said: \"Funding and prioritisation for trading standards are decisions for local authorities - accountable to local communities and the people they serve. Government recognises that consumer protection goes beyond local authority boundaries, which is why we provide \u00c2\u00a315m per year for coordinated Trading Standards activity in the UK.\""

They want to push up the price of crude oil, which is less than half what it was in June 2014 In previous episodes of falling prices, Opec has been much quicker to respond, often cutting output. The agenda for the meeting in Doha, the capital of Qatar, is a freeze in production. No cuts in other words, just a commitment to no more increases. But even that possibility has given some support in recent weeks to the price of oil. The low it reached earlier this year was about $27 a barrel for Brent crude oil, one of the leading international market prices. This week it has been very close to $45. That is to a large extent due to traders considering the possibility that some oil producers are close to taking some sort of action to push prices higher. It's worth emphasising that even at current levels the price of oil is far below where it was as recently as June 2014 - when it reached $115. The fall has hurt many oil producing countries. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund said it had damaged financial stability and the government finances in many of them. The meeting is not formally an Opec event, though all or very nearly all the group's members will be represented. There will also be some non-members, notably Russia. The decision to hold this meeting, with a rather unusual group of attendees, reflects the oil exporters' persistent concerns about the level of prices and a feeling that any action needs to involve more than just the members of Opec. Two of the world's leading producers are not going to be there: the US and China. Both countries have large oil production industries, but they use nearly all of it themselves, and have to import extra to meet their own needs. Their economies overall tend to benefit from cheaper oil so they don't have a shared interest with those who will be turning up in Doha. Still, there is more than enough oil production that will be represented there to make a substantial difference to the global market if the participants chose to take strong action. What many oil analysts say, however, is that they aren't talking about action that is going to achieve much. In the past, Opec has often managed to agree and deliver cuts in production. This time all that's on the table is a potential agreement to refrain from further increases. Among the countries attending there is certainly a good deal of support for the idea. But one important player, an Opec member, is determined to increase its production: Iran. As the country emerges from western sanctions, the Iranian government wants to regain the share of the market that it lost as a result of those restrictions on its international sales. Iran is not even sending its oil minister Bijan Zanganeh to the meeting, although another senior official is expected"

Archaeologist David Jacques, said: \"They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall.\" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a \"modern bungalow\". \"They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,\" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with \"exotic\" stones from outside the area. \"There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,\" explained Mr Jacques. \"It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them.\" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. \"It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,\" he said. \"It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. \"This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like.\" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: \"I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. \"It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.\""

      "text": "Some argue that Africans have never had so much artistic freedom, with a proliferation of books, paintings and films since the advent of multi-party democracy in the 1990s, and the huge advance in technology which has allowed anyone with a smartphone to publish their views across the world. But critics say artists are still subject to tight censorship, pointing out that a South African gallery was forced to remove a painting of President Jacob Zuma under political pressure, while in Uganda a play about gay rights was banned. So, just how free are Africa's artists - in film, literature and music- to tell their own stories? Here are some of their experiences: Having been born and raised in Uganda, it was the best place to be. It was my home and my everything. I remember joining the film industry in 1999 - everything was still good. You didn't need a licence to shoot a film, no censor body to look at your script. All you had to do was get a camera, run to the streets, shoot something and lock yourself in the edit suite - and later put your work out there for the world to see. Today, I have grown to understand that not all stories can be told and not just any film can be done here. There are topics you have to think twice before tackling or which, for your safety, are better left untold. Topics that will get even actors saying: \"I think I am not the right person for that role\" even when you know they can pull it off. Here, you don't just wake up to say you are doing a film about the gay community, a film about the political situation, or a film that paints a bad picture of Uganda. One day I had to drop a story that was inspired by the practice of female genital mutilation amongst some communities in Uganda. I had strong interviews and had done thorough research, but everyone kept telling me it was not safe to go ahead. But it is still my home, my Uganda, my everything. I don't think anyone is free to exercise their art. And that includes artists. There is a cost for this freedom. Artists are no different to the entrepreneur in that financial resources are required for the capital outlay of the \"work\" or manuscript. Just to be in a position to indulge in the work is time spent creating a product without the immediate benefit of financial return. Then the work needs to be produced depending upon the format and genre, requiring additional resources. In the case of a writer, it is then given to a publisher, who spends even more resources to fine-tune the manuscript with an editor, proof reader, type setter, graphic designer etc. which could take considerable time before it is placed on the retail shelf. Since the work now becomes a joint investment, compromise is inevitable. So, I guess artists are free to tell their story if they have the resources to indulge in this freedom."

They say interest in the 23 June poll is high although the campaign is perceived as being dominated by \"old men shouting at each other\". Young people are twice as likely not to be signed up as the public at large. In five weeks' time, the UK will decide whether it should remain a member of the European Union or not, with British citizens aged 18 and over and specified others entitled to vote. It will be the first public vote on the country's future in Europe for more than 50 years. Amid concerns about levels of youth turnout, efforts are being stepped up to encourage young people to sign up to vote in time to take part. Those who registered ahead of the local and national elections on 5 May do not need to re-register. The #TurnUp campaign, which launches on 31 May, is focused on getting young voters to encourage their friends and colleagues to sign up at events in universities, youth clubs, workplaces and cafes. A survey of 1,300 18-30 year olds carried out by YouGov suggests 51% are closely following the referendum, 39% are not while 10% are avoiding coverage of it altogether. While the majority - 52% - of those polled said the economy was the most important issue in determining how to vote, the research found low levels of trust in those representing either side in the referendum debate. Only 10% of those canvassed trusted politicians to make the case for either a Remain or Leave vote, while the figures for the media (13%) and business leaders (16%) were only slightly higher. In contrast, teachers and academics scored much higher levels of trust (72%) as did other young people (50%). Bite the Ballot's director Mike Sani said it was vital the campaign was not merely the preserve of politicians and business people. \"We need to act now to ensure those unregistered are empowered and inspired to take a role in the decision-making process,\" he said. \"Young people will be living longest with the outcome and the risk of not engaging them in the issue is too big to ignore.\" And Hope not Hate said there would be serious consequences if young people were shut out of the debate. \"It is vital they get registered but also vital for both Remain and Leave campaigners to address the concerns of the young far more directly,\" said its chief executive Nick Lowles. \"We know that if they don't, and the voices of the young are not heard, disaffection can breed alienation. That in turn can act as a potent lure for extremists and others who would divide society.\" The groups say 30% of all 18-24 year olds are not registered to vote at the moment and, of those who signed up to vote in last year's general election, only 54% ended up voting - much lower than other age groups."

Nadal, 28, made his announcement after losing 6-2 7-6 (7-4) to Croatian teenager Borna Coric in the quarter-finals of the Swiss Indoors on Friday. \"I'm not going to Paris and London - I'm not competitive enough,\" the nine-time French Open champion said. \"I am going to have surgery on 3 November.\" Nadal had already qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals event, so the Spaniard's withdrawal means the player ranked ninth in the final ATP Race to London rankings will make it through to the season-ending event at the O2 in Greenwich. Britain's Andy Murray will compete in next week's Paris Masters, which is the final ranking event of the season. The Scot, 27, currently lies in eighth position in the Race to London standings. The Swiss Indoors in Basel was just the third tournament Nadal had played since Wimbledon following a wrist injury, and he revealed earlier this month that he was on a course of antibiotics for his appendix. Coric, 17, showed no fear as he raced into a 5-0 lead against a wayward Nadal and held his nerve to secure a stunning victory. Coric learned his tennis travelling between Zagreb and north London under the guidance of British coach Ryan Jones, although the pair have gone their separate ways in recent days. The Croat goes on to face Belgian David Goffin in the semi-finals, with Ivo Karlovic up against Roger Federer, who beat Grigor Dimitrov 7-6 (7-4) 6-2."

      "text": "Two separate proceedings, one by a cross-party group of MLAs and another from victims' campaigner Raymond McCord, were heard earlier this month. A judge ruled there was nothing in the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement to prevent the government triggering Article 50, the formal legal process for leaving the EU. The UK government welcomed the ruling. Mr McCord said that \"without a doubt\" he would be taking his case to the Supreme Court. \"The judge has left the door open,\" he said. \"We're right in what we're doing for the people of this country.\" The challenge by politicians from Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the Alliance Party and the Green Party suggested the UK government could not trigger Article 50 without a parliamentary vote. They said the Brexit decision should be examined and voted on by parliament or, failing that, by the Northern Ireland Assembly. Earlier this month, the High Court in London heard that the need for parliament to give its approval before the Brexit process starts is of huge \"constitutional importance\". Mr McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries and who now campaigns for victims of violence during Northern Ireland's Troubles, brought Friday's other legal bid. His challenge came amid worries that the Brexit vote could mean an end to EU funding for peace projects that help Troubles victims. His lawyer argued that the Good Friday Agreement meant Westminster had given sovereignty of Northern Ireland over to its people, and that leaving the EU would have a \"catastrophic effect\" for the peace process. Major constitutional changes such as leaving the EU could not therefore be imposed by a Westminster government, Mr McCord's barrister said. But the judge ruled that prerogative power could still be used, arguing that triggering Article 50 is merely the start of a legislative process in which acts of parliament will be necessary. \"While the wind of change may be about to blow, the precise direction in which it will blows cannot be determined,\" he said. He concluded that discussing the use of prerogative power to enact the EU referendum result was not suitable for a judicial review. It had also been argued that the Good Friday Agreement gave the power of sovereignty to the people of Northern Ireland and that the Westminster government could not therefore make the region leave the EU. But the judge rejected that argument as well, saying he could not see anything in the agreement or the relevant legislation that confirmed that view. All of the issues raised by the applicants were rejected by the court. The pound dropped in the wake of the ruling, with analysts speculating that it had weighed on the currency. Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in's John O'Down said Remain-supporting politicians would \"continue to explore every legal and political option open to us\" to ensure that citizens' rights are \"protected and upheld\". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood acknowledged that the cost of taking the case to the Supreme Court could be an issue. But he added: \"We believe very, very strongly that Brexit would have a hugely"

He was convicted and sentenced to death. But he was reprieved a few years later after new evidence appeared. But back in America, decades later, an immigration judge ruled there was enough evidence to prove he had been a guard at other Nazi camps, and he was sent abroad for trial again in 2009. The Munich case, in which he was given a five-year jail sentence, is expected to be Germany's last big war crimes trial. Born Ivan Demjanjuk on 3 April 1920 in the Ukrainian village of Dubovi Makharintsi, he was raised under Soviet rule. A burly man, he worked as a tractor and lorry driver on a Ukrainian collective farm. Little can be said with certainty about Mr Demjanjuk's activities during World War II. He joined the Red Army like millions of others, and was serving in eastern Crimea in 1942 when he was captured by the Germans. At least three million Soviet soldiers are believed by historians to have died in German prison camps, many of them left to starve. \"I would have given my soul for a loaf of bread,\" Mr Demjanjuk said later in court. At his trial in Israel, he testified that he had been held at a camp in Chelmno, Poland, until 1944 before being moved to another camp in Austria where he joined a Nazi-backed unit of Russian soldiers fighting communist rule. But according to German prosecutors, between March and September 1943, he was in fact involved in the murders of tens of thousands of Jews at the Nazis' Sobibor death camp in Poland. They said they had obtained hundreds of documents and a number of prosecution witnesses. \"For the first time we have even found lists of names of the people who Demjanjuk personally led into the gas chambers,\" said Kurt Schrimm, head of the special office investigating Nazi crimes. After the war, Demjanjuk lived in southern Germany, working as a driver for various international refugee organisations, according to Germany's Spiegel magazine. In 1952, he emigrated to the US with his wife and child, eventually settling in Cleveland, where he worked as an engine mechanic at a car plant. He was naturalised as a US citizen but his citizenship was temporarily removed after a US judge ruled in 1981 that he had lied in his citizenship application about his wartime activities. Israeli prosecutors requested his extradition in 1983. They believed Mr Demjanjuk was Ivan the Terrible - one of the most infamous guards at Treblinka. Ivan had helped operate the gas chambers and personally murdered hundreds of prisoners, hacking many of his naked victims to death with a sword, according to witnesses. A US court rejected his appeal against deportation in 1985. The court dismissed doubts cast over the authenticity of an ID card, which the defence said was a forgery. The card showed that Mr Demjanjuk belonged to"

Crawley, who were relegated from League One earlier this month, had been without a manager since John Gregory left the West Sussex club on 9 May. \"My job is to put a competitive squad together that will challenge at the right end of the table,\" 45-year-old Yates told the Crawley website. He spent almost five years in charge of Cheltenham and guided them to the League Two play-offs in 2012 and 2013. After successive top-seven finishes and unsuccessful play-off campaigns, Cheltenham finished 17th in League Two in 2013-14. And ex-Kidderminster boss Yates was then sacked late last year, following a run of four successive league defeats that left them 18th. He was the third-longest serving manager in England's top four divisions at the time of his departure from Whaddon Road. \"I have been out of the game for a few months and when this opportunity came up it really excited me,\" he said. \"There's a big challenge ahead but one I am really looking forward to.\" Gregory, 60, parted company with Crawley earlier this month, having spent the past six months recuperating from heart surgery. Dean Saunders was placed in interim charge of the Reds in December, but was unable to save the club from the drop to League Two. The 50-year-old former Liverpool and Aston Villa striker was appointed Chesterfield manager last week. Crawley chief executive Michael Dunford said that Yates stood out among \"some very strong candidates\". He added: \"He has a very deep knowledge of the level we find ourselves at next season and is a first-rate coach. \"The board spoke to several people in the game who have worked with Mark and they were all very positive about his credentials, his knowledge and his enthusiasm.\""

A European commissioner has warned the British government that it needs to make a strategic choice - whether it wants to stay inside the single market or not. Valdis Dombrovskis, commissioner for the euro, told the BBC there had been mixed messages from Mrs May's government - on the one hand wanting to stay in the internal market, on the other had not respecting freedom of movement. Mrs May has made it clear she wants some curbs on immigration from the EU. But Mr Dombrovskis told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend there can't be cherry picking, and the commission is waiting for a formal notification of what the UK wants. He was speaking at a conference in Italy organised by an Italian think tank called the European House - Ambrosetti. It is like a European Davos, a gathering of business leaders and bankers, politicians past and present - in short, the European elite. Most of the sessions are private but we spoke to a number of senior figures on the record. Former Irish Taoiseach John Bruton expressed incredulity that Mrs May doesn't want to start negotiations until next year. \"There's a lot of surprise in European capitals that a party that had promised a referendum in its manifesto hadn't decided in advance what it would look for if people voted to leave,\" he said. \"One would have thought they would have prepared, but they don't appear to have done that.\" Former head of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet told us there would be a period of uncertainty. \"I would call for this period to be as short as possible, and for the position of the British government to be as clear as possible, as soon as possible,\" he said. Greek Economy Minister Giorgos Stathakis told us: \"The hard part of the story is that the EU is quite strict - free trade means free movement, it is difficult to find a compromise.\" I asked him if he would back such a compromise. \"We wouldn't - whatever compromises take place will include reduction in access to trade,\" he said. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, leading plans for Brexit alongside Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande, has let it be known that he hopes the UK can become the EU's \"best friend\". But he's warned the split-up should happen as soon as possible - and it will be impossible for the UK to keep all the advantages of membership. Former Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti told me that if Britain was given concessions over free movement it would mean the end of the free market. He said he would swear on oath that other countries would also want to cherry pick, and that would be devastating and lead to the collapse of the single market. He also said there could be one positive outcome from the \"disgraceful\" Brexit - other leaders may be warned off attacking the EU to strengthen"

Ian Hosking, an expert in design for the elderly at the University of Cambridge's engineering design centre, believes we need to get the basics right first. \"There are some very tech-savvy older people around, but there is clearly a large cohort of people who feel excluded by technology. They find it a bit impenetrable,\" he says. I would probably include my mother in that latter category. She is in her 80s and has made valiant efforts to get to grips with a wide range of technology, from a creaking hand-me-down computer to a Kindle and online shopping. Now, she wants to buy a tablet but is worried that she will not know how to use it. She is not alone - according to the US Pew Internet research centre, 77% of older people would need someone to help walk them through the process of setting up a new device. Aimed specifically at the older generation, Breezie offers a simplified interface for a standard Samsung Galaxy tablet. It can be customised to make sure it has the settings and apps the customer wants, rather than a bunch of preset ones they will never use. And the ones they do have are made easy to use - so, for example, someone wanting to use Skype simply has to tap on a friend's picture in the address book. Company founder Jeh Kazimi told BBC News Breezie had been inspired by his own mother. \"I watched her trying to navigate the internet and saw that she found it intimidating and complicated,\" he says. \"I couldn't find anything on the market that could make the internet work for her, so I created it myself.\" \"Our goal was to design software that makes the online environment considerably more accessible for people with little or no technological nous and to do so without patronising or limiting them.\" Users can give a trusted relative or friend the ability to sign-in remotely, set-up accounts and add contacts, via Breezie's support service. Last year it teamed up with Age UK to launch the tablet, which costs \u00c2\u00a3299 with the Breezie platform pre-installed. It is easy to assume that older people will find a gadget as simple to use as you do. As an iPad user, I saw no reason my mother could not get to grips with it - but, actually, it is not as simple as that. The response time for icons on an Apple screen is 0.7 seconds, but the over-65s have a response time of about one second. Using touchscreens may come naturally enough to a toddler but not necessarily for an older person - the nerves in the finger become less sensitive with age, meaning older people may \"touch\" far more heavily. And tests suggest that if an older person has a slight tremor, it can be registered on a device as a swipe rather than a touch. \"It is"

But their son woke up and after seeing his mother's body wrapped in a rug, showed police where it happened. The family has been speaking ahead of a documentary about the murder case. The body of Ms Hemming - who shared a surname with her partner but they were not married - was found in Hertfordshire woodland three weeks after she disappeared. More news from Buckinghamshire She was reported missing two days after she vanished by her mother, who voiced concerns to police about Hemming. Hemming, 43, who had murdered her after hearing she was having an affair, was jailed for at least 20 years in November. Ms Hemming's sisters Kerry Hammond and Joanne Beverley have told the BBC Hemming was a \"very charming, smiley, happy guy that could quite frankly sell ice to Eskimos\".

But Fred Warmbier said his son had been treated \"brutally\". He spoke as an Ohio hospital said Otto had suffered a \"severe neurological injury\" and is in a stable condition. \"We went for 15 months without a word from or about Otto,\" Mr Warmbier said of his son, who fought back tears at Thursday's press conference in Cincinnati, Ohio. \"It was only a week ago that the North Korean government now claims that he was in a coma for almost all of that time. \"Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we don't - there's no excuse for a civilised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care.\" Otto Warmbier, an economics student from the University of Virginia, was arrested in January 2016 while visiting North Korea as a tourist. Botulism is a type of poisoning which can cause total body paralysis, difficulty in breathing and death in some cases. It's caused by the clostridium botulinum bacteria, but the symptoms of botulism are not from the bacteria themselves. Instead, the microscopic organisms produce a powerful toxin which attacks the nervous system and causes paralysis. That poison is called botulinum - which you may know for its commercial use in Botox, which removes wrinkles by paralysing facial muscles. Botulism is contracted in two ways in adults - by eating food contaminated with the toxin, or through wounds. The foodborne method happens when the bacteria are tinned or stored in food in another way that deprives them from air (which is when they produce the poison). This rarely happens in modern western food production, but is what North Korea claims happened to Mr Warmbier. He was given a 15-year prison sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. Fred Warmbier told reporters his son had been held as a \"war criminal'. He said he and his wife, Cindy, had relied \"on this false premise that they would treat Otto fairly and let him go\". In honour of his son, Fred Warmbier wore the same jacket Otto was wearing when he was paraded before media to tearfully confess to attempting to take the sign as a \"trophy\" for a US church. Mr Warmbier also appeared to criticise the Obama administration for failing to help secure his son's release. How harsh is prison in North Korea? \"When Otto was first taken we were advised by the past administration to take a low profile while they worked to obtain his release,\" he said. \"We did so without result. Earlier this year Cindy and I decided the time for strategic patience was over.\" The university student was freed hours after US basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea, but Fred Warmbier said the professional athlete's visit had nothing to do with his son's release.

      "text": "BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for \u00c2\u00a31. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as \"a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience\". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of \u00c2\u00a31bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight.

The meeting followed claims the Tory MP called police \"plebs\", which he denied. Another officer, Sgt Chris Jones, has been cleared of misconduct. Det Sgt Hinton is from Warwickshire Police, Insp Mackaill works for West Mercia Police and Sgt Jones for West Midlands police. All three officers, who are Police Federation representatives in the Midlands, met the Conservative MP at his Sutton Coldfield constituency office in October 2012 to find out what he had said during a row in Downing Street. It followed reports he had sworn at officers and called them \"plebs\" for refusing to let him cycle though the street's main gate. After the meeting the men said Mr Mitchell had not given a full account and called for him to resign. But a recording of the meeting cast doubt on what they had said. The three officers then faced further criticism over evidence they gave to MPs before the home affairs select committee in October 2013. Carl Gumsley, commissioner for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), directed Warwickshire Police on Monday to hold a misconduct hearing for Det Sgt Hinton. This was after the force declined to follow Mr Gumsley's earlier recommendation that there was a case to answer. West Mercia Police had decided, in line with Mr Gumsley's opinion, that Insp Mackaill has a case to answer for gross misconduct, and he should therefore face a misconduct hearing. In 2014, a High Court judge rejected a libel case brought by Mr Mitchell against the Sun newspaper, concluding that \"on the balance of probabilities\" he had called a police officer a \"pleb\". Mr Mitchell has accepted he used bad language but said he had not used that particular word. He paid \u00c2\u00a3300,000 in legal costs after losing the case. Last year, the High Court described a misconduct investigation into the actions of the trio as \"lamentable\" saying there was a \"series of errors and irregularities\". The case was then referred back to the IPCC."

But it left open a number of questions - did he mean everyone, no matter how remote, what technology will be used, and who is going to pay for it? Here is what David Cameron said: \"Just as our forebears effectively brought gas, electricity and water to all, we're going to bring fast broadband to every home and business that wants it.\" As the government has already promised to bring fast broadband to 95% of homes via the BDUK programme, this is all about reaching the final 5%. The digital minister Ed Vaizey gave further detail, explaining that the plan was to bring in a universal service obligation of 10Mbps for \"the very hardest to reach homes and businesses.\" But does that mean every home - even those up Welsh mountains or on remote Scottish islands? Let's presume it does, though just as with the obligation on BT to provide a phone line, there may be some upper limit on the costs involved in hooking up a home. Broadband campaigners have not greeted the government's pledge with huge enthusiasm. In particular, they have derided that 10Mbps minimum as woefully inadequate. I contacted a number of them to ask what the minimum speed should be and got answers ranging from 15Mbps to 100Mbps. There was also general agreement that fibre to the home was the technology which should be employed, though a few pointed out that 4G was now providing better speeds in some areas than fixed line broadband. The problem is that, even at a minimum 10Mbps, a universal service may prove an expensive undertaking and the cost of putting a 100Mbps fibre connection in every corner of the UK could be prohibitive. When the debate about fast broadband got going, it was calculated that universal coverage might cost at least \u00c2\u00a315 billion. A government which is implementing severe cuts in public spending will not be keen to put more money into broadband - although of course it is worth remembering that most of the cash spent so far on the BDUK programme has come from the TV licence fee. And just about all of that spending has been channelled through BT, which was the only company to apply for the money in most regions. Now the former monopoly telephone supplier looks likely to be a the centre of the effort to hook up the last 5%. But even if the government wanted to spend taxpayer funds to make that happen, there will be resistance from BT's rivals. Virgin Media has already called for an end to subsidies for rural broadband, claiming the market can now do the job - although it isn't clear that it will be moving to offer cable to every remote home. Meanwhile, there are signs of a split opening up between town and country over the subsidy issue. The director of the free market Institute of Economic Affairs Mark Littlewood told Radio 4's PM that people living in remote rural areas had made that choice,"

Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become \"a strong possibility\". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains \"severe\" and an attack is \"highly likely\". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a \"substantial number of explosive devices\". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant \"both in terms of its size and its capability\". \"A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,\" he added. \"This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives.\" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. \"There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,\" Det Supt Geddes said. He added that police are \"indebted\" to the two people who noticed the suspicious objects in the Capanagh Forest."

But when film icon Sir Michael Gambon likes the sounds of \"Don't Take Me Home\" so much that he fancies dropping by this week's London premiere then you realise the sporting storyline is a little special. \"When you hear a movie legend like that, likes the story then you know you've got a storyline that has a wide appeal beyond Welsh football,\" said director Jonny Owen. Don't Take Me Home, named after Wales football fans' Euro 2016 terrace anthem, premieres fittingly on St David's Day. But like Wales' down-to-earth players, the official premiere is far from the glitz and glamour of Leicester Square but more an industrial park outside of Pontypridd. But in the week that Leicester City's fall from Premier League grace finally unravelled with the sacking of their manager, you might be forgiven for thinking this is just an overindulgence about just another sporting fairytale. Hardly. This starts with the most tragic of beginnings - the death of Wales football manager Gary Speed. A group of young players, most of whom were friends after growing up together in Welsh youth teams, had to deal with the grief of not just losing their boss but their role model. In that context, what they achieved less than five years later - qualifying for Wales' first major championship finals in almost 60 years - seems \"worthy of immortalising in film\". It was certainly beyond the wildest fantasies of any Welsh football fan - especially when they were below Haiti and Guatemala at 117 in the world rankings in 2011. Then in November of the same year, Speed was found hanged in his garage, aged just 42. It did not just resonate in Wales and football, Speed's death shocked the country. \"Wales were constantly suffering so-called heartache, failing to qualify for tournaments at the final hurdle, but Gary's tragic death put those disappointments into perspective,\" said Owen. \"Gary's death was obviously devastating for his family and friends, but the sadness and grief must have affected this group of young lads who were loving playing football for one of their Welsh footballing heroes. \"It seemed to have a profound affect on them. It seemed to galvanise an already pretty strong bond, a togetherness and also context - as if they could come through this, then playing football and dealing with that pressure would be easier. \"No-one could have predicted then that virtually the same team would create history at Euro 2016 - those boys have some character.\" The rise to the European Championships was Roy of the Rovers stuff. Built on a foundation of structured defending with the added sprinkle of stardust from the world's most expensive player, Wales defied the odds and not just qualified for their first finals since the 1958 World Cup - they reached the semi-finals. No other team in history has risen up Fifa's world rankings quicker than Wales."

Ministers have declined to confirm reports that a written promise was made to protect the company from any consequences of Brexit. Labour said the government should set out exactly what was promised. Speaking on BBC Question Time, Mr Clark indicated there had been no offer of financial compensation or state aid. \"There's no cheque book. I don't have a cheque book,\" he said. \"The important thing is that they know this is a country in which they can have confidence they can invest. That was the assurance and the understanding they had and they have invested their money.\" He said the announcement was \"fantastic news\", particularly for the workforce as the deal secures 7,000 jobs. The Japanese company's commitment to Britain's biggest car plant had been in doubt following the referendum on EU membership. Mr Clark's department declined to comment on a report in the Times newspaper that he had written to Nissan's board promising to ensure that UK operations would \"remain competitive\" after Britain left the EU. According to the newspaper, \"Mr Clark's letter is regarded by Nissan as a promise that it will not have to bear the cost of punitive tariffs on car exports if Britain leaves the EU customs area without a free trade agreement in place\". The Nissan announcement has led to calls from other car manufacturers for similar pledges. Toyota said it trusted the government to provide \"fair treatment\". But a senior Nissan Europe executive, Colin Lawther, said the company had received \"no special deal\". \"It's just a commitment from the government to work with the whole of the automotive industry to make sure the whole automotive industry in the UK remains competitive,\" he told the BBC. \"We would expect nothing for us that the rest of the industry wouldn't be able to have access to. We see this as a whole industry thing, not a Nissan thing.\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government must disclose any deals struck with the firm, saying it could not hide it from the public. Nissan confirmed it would build both the new Qashqai and the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. A company spokesman said making the X-Trail could lead to hundreds of new jobs being created in the coming years. It will be the first time the model has been made outside Japan. The plant produced 475,000 vehicles last year - 80% of which were exported. Production of the next Qashqai model is expected to begin in 2018 or 2019."

Opinion is sharply divided, however, as to whether or not it is wise to invest in the country. Since 2004, its economy has been expanding by about 10% a year. The government expects growth to continue in double digits - but a report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests it will slow to 6.5% in 2013. Even the IMF predictions are impressive, however, considering the current global financial climate and the fact that unlike many other countries on the continent, Ethiopia does not have much in the way of natural resources. Coffee is one of the biggest export earners in Ethiopia. In Addis Ababa, the country's capital, coffee exporter Michael Girma says it was a challenge to launch his business. \"To start up in the export sector, you need to perform with your own cash. Then after that, you can approach the banks,\" he says. Apart from exporting coffee, he now also owns a cafe, a bar, and a pizzeria, employing 140 people altogether. Although the business environment is getting very competitive, he is achieving a profit margin of 20-30% each year and feels confident about the future. \"A lot has changed in the last seven years,\" he says. \"You need to be aggressive, but not arrogant.\" Although foreign investors are encouraged, many sectors are reserved for domestic investors. \"The restricted sectors are those which supply to the local people. If foreign investors want to come in and invest in projects which are export oriented, anything is open,\" he says. \"It would be very hard to compete otherwise.\" Despite annual high inflation, some investors think the potential in Africa's second most populous nation has not been recognised. Earlier this year, Shultze Global Investments launched a $100m equity fund aiming to invest in Ethiopian businesses. In a nondescript building on a hillside overlooking Addis Ababa, Berhane Demissie decides where to put that money. \"Ethiopia offers significant opportunities for investors,\" she says, pointing out that agriculture is a strong growth sector. \"Anything grows in Ethiopia with the various climate and soil diversities that we have. That also follows through to the agricultural value-added chain with processing and exports,\" Ms Demissie says. With 85% of the population dependent on the agricultural sector, she says the government is trying to ensure those farmers have access to finance and fertilisers that will allow them to grow more. Ms Demissie says this will lift people out of poverty. \"If the programme was just about big farms I would have said no, but the smallholder farmers are being included in the overall growth of the economy,\" she says. She also says there is a lot more demand for consumer goods and services within the country, but too few manufacturing companies.

Mr Farage said he was \"not particularly in favour of Mr Hamilton's return to the front line, aged nearly 70\". Mr Hamilton replied: \"If Attenborough can still survive in a jungle of wild animals and predators at 90, I'm sure I'll be fine in the assembly.\" Mr Farage, who is 15 years younger than Mr Hamilton, had described the treatment of Mr Gill as \"an act of deep ingratitude\" after UKIP won its first seats in the assembly. Speaking about Mr Hamilton on LBC radio on Friday, Mr Farage said: \"I think it is difficult to return to frontline politics after a 20-year gap when you are getting on a bit in years. \"But there you are, perhaps he'll surprise me.\" He added: \"One thing I will say, he is utterly committed to this EU cause, and he has been since the 1960,\" referring to Mr Hamilton's opposition to UK membership of the European Union. In response, Mr Hamilton said: \"The average UKIP member will be very disappointed at Nigel's ageist remark. \"UKIP has many thousands of active and vigorous senior members. \"It seems particularly odd to knock old age at the very moment we celebrate the 90th birthdays of two icons of Britishness - Her Majesty the Queen and Sir David Attenborough. \"If Attenborough can still survive in a jungle of wild animals and predators at 90, I'm sure I'll be fine in the assembly. \"Clement Atlee was 65 when, as Prime Minister, he introduced the NHS. \"Churchill was 72 when he led us to victory against the Nazis. \"Ronald Reagan was 77 when he brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union and ended the Cold War. \"Is Nigel suggesting he could have done a better job than any of them, because he is 15 years younger than me?\" Among those who supported Nathan Gill in the leadership vote last week was Mark Reckless, a former Conservative MP and now a AM for South Wales East. Asked what the relationship between Mr Hamilton and Mr Gill was like, Mr Reckless said: \"Not good.\" \"I hope over time wounds will heal and we'll want to do the best for the people who voted for us and Wales as a whole,\" he told BBC Wales on Thursday. Mr Reckless said he had supported Mr Gill in the leadership challenge, but added: \"I accept the result.\" Of Mr Hamilton's bid to go for leader, Mr Reckless said: \"It's not what I would have done, but we are where we are. \"I don't want to say anything critical about Neil on that.\""

Two decades on, the group's influence continues to be identifiable in popular culture - and in some unexpected ways. From how TV and newspapers cover music, to the way stars brand themselves, the Spice Girls influenced many of the rules for 21st Century pop stars. Before 1996, manufactured groups were expected to obey management and music label orders. Even though the five were put together by Bob and Chris Herbert, the group soon decided to replace the father-and-son management team with Simon Fuller. And against record company advice, they also chose their first single. \"If they decided they wanted to do something, then that's what was going to happen,\" says Wannabe's co-writer Richard \"Biff\" Stannard. Visual artist Liz West, a Guinness Book of Records entrant for the world's largest collection of Spice memorabilia (nearly 5,000 items), agrees. \"When it was suggested to people what their first single should be, they had already chosen it,\" she says. Wannabe's release came the year after the battle for chart dominance between the all-male Britpop groups Blur and Oasis. Timing was ripe for an opinionated girl group, says Paul Gorman, the first writer to interview them for Music Week. \"Britpop was a bunch of blokes going through their dads' record collections,\" he says. Wannabe's nursery-rhyme-style hypnotic chant secured a broad coalition of fans including those hard-to-get pre-teens who the music industry had previously considered as a small market. And in the following years, in the run-up to the millennium, the influence of the Spice Girls on this audience, led to the emergence of other acts aimed at a younger market. As a result, acts such as S Club 7, B*Witched, Aqua, Hanson, Steps and Billie Piper started to top the charts. Kim Glover, the manager of girlband B*Witched, who had four number one singles in the slipstream of Spice success says: \"They were very different from what had gone before them. Wannabe jumped out the radio - from the very first bar, you were hooked.\" The single was a springboard for 80m global album sales, and the now ingrained slogan \"Girl Power\". Yet not everyone was convinced. Girl Power, according to Gorman, was \"in many respects an empty phrase\". \"But it did mark a change in the way strong young British women saw themselves in the '90s and reflected the rise of ladette culture.\" \"Half of it was a marketing man's slogan,\" says Liz West. \"But as an 11-year-old girl, it instilled confidence in me.\" Glover is more positive. \"I personally loved it. As a woman in the music business, it resonated with me.\" Many current female stars such as Adele, Emma Stone, Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson have revealed they were and still are fans. Radio 1 DJ Jo Whiley told last month's Radio Times that Adele had Spice Girls photos on her fridge. She sang Spice Up Your Life at her June Amsterdam gig. \"Adele and other female"

China promptly flew in rescue teams, sniffer dogs, medical equipment, tents, blankets and generators. Leaders of both the countries - Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping - were also quick to convey their condolences. \"For many people of our country, Nepalis are our own people,\" said Mr Modi in his monthly radio show on Sunday. The competition for influence in Nepal between the Asian giants is not new, but it appears to have escalated in recent years. Nepal's ties with India run deep and are often, according to many, schizophrenic. Many in Nepal - including the Maoists - have criticised its \"semi-colonial\" relationship with India, spoken about Indian \"expansionism\" and pointed to how their impoverished country had become India's \"bonded market\". Indian traders have controlled much of the lucrative parts of Nepal's economy. Asymmetrical water sharing treaties, many argue, have allowed downstream irrigation benefits for India. Nepalese opposition parties, playing the nationalist card, have sometimes thrived on anti-India rhetoric; and Maoists have derided other mainstream parties as India's brokers. On the other hand, Delhi is geographically, linguistically and culturally much closer to Nepal than China. The anti-India rhetoric softens when political parties come to power. \"India has been a political player in Nepal as much as any Nepali political party,\" says Michael Hutt, professor of Nepali and Himalayan studies at the University of London. Nepalese citizens continue to serve in the Gurkha regiment in Indian army; and Nepalese soldiers are trained in India. India also remains a main supplier of weapons to the Himalayan state. The fact that the two countries share an open border means that India's core interest in Nepal is security, writes Prashant Jha, in Battles of the New Republic: A Contemporary History of Nepal, an incisive account of its chequered recent history. \"Delhi needs a friendly regime in Kathmandu to prevent China from gaining space at its expense.\" So it is no surprise that India has rushed relief to its quake-ravaged neighbour. \"Nepal is central to India. Nepal has a special place in Indian thinking. It cannot be compared to China. India's response to the earthquake would have been strong and one of a kind, anyway,\" says Harsh V Pant, professor of international relations at London's Kings College. Yet, things may not be as simple. China's influence in the region appears to be growing rapidly. Last year China overtook India as Nepal's biggest foreign investor, investing heavily, among other things, in roads, power plants, transport and infrastructure. Trade between the two countries is on an upswing. Beijing has not minced words in telling Kathmandu that it needs to tamp down on pro-Tibet activists on its soil. A 2013 Human Rights Watch report said Nepal \"forcibly\" returns to China many Tibetans arrested at the border in contravention of rules. One report said Taiwan had been asked not to participate in the quake relief effort, although it is not clear whether China had anything to do with it. \"Nepal has also"

In a statement on Friday, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said she is also to establish a fund to tackle organised crime associated with paramilitary groups. The two unionist parties now say they will join cross-party talks on Monday. Unionists had said the issue of continued paramilitary activity was crucial to their involvement. Democratic Unionist Party leader Peter Robinson said he was \"content\" with the announcement. \"Policing and security in Northern Ireland is not just the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive, the secretary of state has a particular responsibility as well,\" Mr Robinson said. The National Crime Agency (NCA) became operational in Northern Ireland in May. Given its wide-ranging remit and resources, it would be reasonable to assume it knows the extent of paramilitary involvement in organised crime in Northern Ireland. It should be in a position to provide an assessment of paramilitary involvement to the Northern Ireland Secretary and political parties. So, it seems unlikely that the review to be published by the independent panel in October will tell Theresa Villiers and political parties anything they could not be told today by the NCA and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Read more He said \"permanent and statutory steps\" to address paramilitary activity and links should be determined within the talks process. The Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt described Ms Villiers statement as a \"positive step forward\". Ms Villiers said the assessment of paramilitaries would be carried out by UK security agencies and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and would be reviewed and checked by three people whose names would be announced early next week. \"I also intend to establish dedicated funding aimed at increasing the capability of agencies working to tackle criminality and organised crime associated with paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland,\" she said. \"It will support agencies to enhance specialist capabilities such as forensic accounting to strengthen their capacity to seize criminal assets. \"Lastly, I am planning to discuss with the Northern Ireland justice minister and the Irish justice minister how we can work best together in our efforts to tackle cross-border crime.\" Read more on how the crisis unfolded In response, Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in's Martin McGuinness said: \"Obviously with today's developments and the response of unionist leaders, as we hoped all-party talks will resume on Monday. \"We're entering the talks on Monday in a positive and constructive spirit.\" But on the subject of the assessment, the deputy first minister added: \"I don't think anybody is going to learn anything over the next four weeks that they didn't know over the last 20 years.\" The Police Service of Northern Ireland's Chief Constable George Hamilton said he welcomed the \"clear focus\" on organised crime that the assessment would provide. Irish Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan said it would be a \"once-off exercise\".

Andrew Watson, an executive director on the Yorkshire Cricket Board, was one of the key thinkers behind the decision. \"We had a national playing survey for three years,\" he said. \"Stronger players and the stronger clubs wanted more competitive cricket and the other players from other leagues wanted more regional cricket, so they didn't have to travel so far. We engaged every league in Yorkshire with that.\" Under the old system, there were two premier leagues - the North Yorkshire League and the South Durham League. The Yorkshire league has been split into two to form Yorkshire League North and Yorkshire League South, with the Bradford League added in. There are then partner leagues beneath these and promotion and relegation are both possible. The clubs are now coming to the end of their first year under this system. The top two teams from each of the premier leagues will feature in an end-of-season champion of champions play-off, with the final taking place in Abu Dhabi in October. One long-standing club affected by this change is Pudsey Congs - former player and club spokesperson Ralph Middlebrook believes the move will bridge the gap between league cricketers and professionals, as clubs that win promotion to one of the premier leagues must also meet ECB ground standards. \"The standard of cricket is going to improve and the standard of pitches is going to improve,\" said Middlebrook. \"There are certain factors that are mandatory on clubs. You must have under-11s, under-13s, under-15s. You must have covers. You must have Clubmark, which is the ECB standard for everything, from child welfare through to development plans. \"It's going to give people who are keen to be professionals the chance to go to a club that's on the verge of the first-class game. \"And it's not just about excellence. It's about the other clubs lower down being able to find their own level.\" He continued: \"If you just want to be a local club, with people in the locality playing and supporting cricket in their area, you can do that. Not all clubs want to be Premier League clubs with the professional standards they would have to provide. \"If you're thinking of being a pro, you'd better go to a decent club with a decent pitch and see if you can hack it.\" Ringing these changes could be difficult for sides with limited resources, but the Yorkshire Cricket Board have a support network in place for clubs facing the transition. There are five development managers and 10 community officers in Yorkshire, and Cricket Development Groups can help clubs work towards Clubmark. There are talks in place to look at implementing this system throughout the country. \"I think ECB and cricket nationally is watching Yorkshire,\" Watson explained. \"We have got 12% of all cricket in the country, so we're the biggest output area. To reorganise the leagues as we've done has taken a lot of discussions - it's taken over 200"

Its chief executive, David Porter, said they were monitoring the situation. \"Rivers Agency and the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) in the south are responsible for controlling the lough levels and we are working closely to ensure everything can be done to reduce the levels and therefore the impact of any flooding,\" he said. \"A combination of generation and spilling at the hydroelectric power stations at Cliff and Ballyshannon in Donegal is ongoing to ensure that water can leave the Erne system as quickly as it can flow down to the dams. \"It should, however, be recognised that heavy rain can result in a greater inflow than can possibly be dealt with, even when spilling is in progress.\" He said the River Blackwater, which flows through counties Armagh and Tyrone, was at its \"highest recorded level in 45 years but has now peaked\".

The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.

For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a \"Facebook revolution\". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

Egypt's Interior Ministry said it would not comment until it had studied the report. The study notes a surge in sexual violence after the Egyptian military takeover in July 2013. The perpetrators are rarely held to account and the impunity points to a \"cynical political strategy aimed at silencing all opposition\". Police, intelligence officers and members of the military are guilty of targeting male and female detainees, according to the report. Among the victims are student demonstrators, human rights activists, gay people and children. Student's ordeal I saw an officer who was grabbing a young woman by the breasts and I said to him: \"If you want to arrest her, then arrest her, but you have no right to touch her breasts.\" He grabbed me exactly as he had her, before calling two other police officers to come and hold me. They beat me, insulted me. In the van they insulted me and beat me so much that I could no longer stand up. Two soldiers started to sexually assault me. The officer from the start got into the van and said to me: \"Come here I'm going to show you if I'm a man.\" He sexually assaulted me, the soldiers laughed, and then he raped me completely. I was paralysed, I started to vomit blood. My life is ruined. I'm afraid of my son, my husband and even my father. The authors said they did not have evidence that commanders were giving the orders, but the scale of the violence - and the impunity - suggested there was a political strategy. They claim that victims who file complaints are systematically obstructed by the justice system, and face threats and reprisals by police officers and prison guards. Sexual violence has long been a problem within the general population in Egypt, with assaults dramatically increasing in the years since Hosni Mubarak was removed from power. Last year, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi ordered police to launch a crackdown amid growing public anger. He said sexual assaults, were \"an unacceptable form of conduct\" and called for citizens to \"reinstate moral values in society\"."

The two companies currently have a combined worldwide workforce of approximately 9,000 people. The information is contained in a detailed prospectus published by Standard Life on the deal. Managers said they expected \"natural turnover\" to account for some of the reductions, while other steps will be taken to minimise compulsory redundancies. The merger of Edinburgh-based Standard Life and Aberdeen is aimed at creating cost savings that could add up to \u00a3200m per year. The prospectus for shareholders stated \"there will be a need to maximise operational efficiencies and cost synergies\" to achieve the expected benefits of the merger. It continued: \"At this time it is estimated that the integration and restructuring will result in a phased reduction of approximately 800 roles from the total global headcount of the combined group as at 31 December 2016 of approximately 9,000 over the three-year integration period. \"Synergies will come in part from employee departures arising from natural turnover. \"Other appropriate steps will be taken to minimise the number of compulsory redundancies, including the active management of Standard Life's and Aberdeen's recruitment and vacancies.\" The document reveals that the newly-merged company will be renamed Standard Life Aberdeen plc. Both companies have agreed on a 16-strong board made up of an equal number of Standard Life and Aberdeen directors. Standard Life chairman Sir Gerry Grimstone will be the chairman of the newly-merged company while Aberdeen's chairman Simon Troughton will become deputy chairman. Keith Skeoch, the Standard Life chief executive, and Aberdeen boss Martin Gilbert will become co-chief executives of the new firm. The two companies agreed the terms of the merger, which will create Britain's biggest asset manager, in March. Under the terms of the deal, Aberdeen shareholders would own 33.3% and Standard Life shareholders would own 66.7% of the combined group. A general meeting has been scheduled for June at which shareholders will be asked to approve the merger. If backed, the deal is expected to be closed by mid-August."

The Pope was celebrating a Christmas eve Mass in St Peter's Basilica in front of about 10,000 people. Later on Friday he will deliver his traditional Christmas message from the central balcony of St Peter's Square. Celebrating Mass, the Pope said Christmas was the time to \"once more discover who we are\". He called on believers to show the same simplicity as the child Jesus, \"born into poverty in a manger despite his divinity\" to inspire their lives. \"In a society so often intoxicated by consumerism and hedonism, wealth and extravagance, appearances and narcissism, this child calls us to act soberly, in other words, in a way that is simple, balanced, consistent, capable of seeing and doing what is essential,\" he said. World's Christians celebrate Christmas Welby: Islamic State is Herod of today \"Amid a culture of indifference which not infrequently turns ruthless, our style of life should instead be devout, filled with empathy, compassion and mercy.\" Security was tight at the service with police carrying out spot checks in the area surrounding the Vatican. Everyone who went into the basilica, the largest church in Christendom, had to pass through metal detectors. Correspondents say the Pope, 79, used his homily to reflect the key themes of three years in office - mercy, compassion, empathy and justice. \"In a world which all too often is merciless to the sinner and lenient to the sin, we need to cultivate a strong sense of justice, to discern and to do God's will,\" he said. His voice was occasionally hoarse - the effect of a slight flu earlier this week."

Among them is a likely agreement with French aircraft manufacturer Airbus for more than 100 new aircraft. Mr Rouhani will also meet French President Francois Hollande. Mr Rouhani's five-day visit to Italy and France is the first by an Iranian president in nearly two decades, as the Iranian president seeks to rebuild economic ties and secure new trade deals. Iran is likely to need hundreds of new aircraft in the coming years as it re-establishes commercial air travel restricted by the sanctions, and French carmakers will once again be free to supply to the Islamic Republic. As well as a deal for Airbus planes, contracts are likely to be signed with car manufacturers Peugeot and Renault, Mr Rouhani told reporters on Monday. In Italy, Mr Rouhani met with President Matteo Renzi and Pope Francis. Monday saw contracts worth around \u20ac17bn ($18.4bn; \u00a312bn) signed between Iranian and Italian companies. At Rome's Capitoline Museum, where Mr Rouhani and Mr Renzi met, nude statues were covered up and wine was removed from official menus out of respect for the Islamic Republic's strict laws governing propriety. Iranian diplomats reportedly requested that no wine be served at Mr Rouhani's lunch meeting with Mr Hollande, leading French officials to postpone the meeting until after lunch. During their meeting, Pope Francis urged Iran to work with other Middle Eastern countries against terrorism and arms trafficking, the Vatican said. Iran has been accused of funding militant groups, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon. Mr Rouhani asked the pontiff to pray for him, and gave him the gift of a hand-made carpet."

Colombia's Catholic Church has said euthanasia is morally unacceptable and it has threatened to close its hospitals across the country. Colombia is one of the few countries in the world, and the only one in Latin America, where euthanasia is allowed. Assisted suicide was approved by the Constitutional Court in the 1990s. But no procedures had been performed because the measure had not been regulated. It was only in May that the health ministry intervened and issued a set of guidelines for hospitals. Mr Gonzalez died in a clinic in the western city of Pereira, after a legal battle. His son Julio Cesar is a cartoonist with one of Colombia's top newspapers, El Tiempo. \"My father received the news [that the procedure had been approved] with relief,\" said Mr Gonzalez, better known by his pen name Matador, or The Killer. \"It is a pity that it had to be like that. My dad deserved to go with less publicity,\" he added. Euthanasia is highly controversial in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.

Bitfinex told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that nearly 120,000 bitcoin were stolen from its exchange platform. All transactions on the virtual exchange have been suspended while the security breach is investigated. In a statement on its website, Bitfinex said that it was \"deeply concerned about the issue and we are committing every resource to try to resolve it\". The hack is one of the biggest thefts in bitcoin's history and is being treated as a \"major deal\" by many in the virtual currency community. \"Unfortunately, we continue to have vulnerabilities in the form of exchanges and wallets,\" former Singapore-based bitcoin broker David Moskowitz told the BBC. \"The vulnerabilities almost always occur on the exchange or wallet side and this is an area that continues to need improvement and more secure protocols, no different than when a bank gets robbed.\" Securing bitcoin trading platforms has been a key challenge, with hacking and thefts seen as the biggest threats. In 2014, the Tokyo-based Mt Gox trading exchange declared bankruptcy when hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins vanished or were stolen. But Mr Moskowitz stressed that in spite of the latest alleged theft \"the core protocol is extremely robust and has not been hacked\". He said while there would most likely be a price correction in bitcoin, he remained confident that it would continue to be an appealing alternative asset."

Gaines, who was armed with a shotgun, was shot dead in her apartment while her 5-year-old son watched. Police said her followers on Facebook encouraged her not to give in. According to Facebook's policies, accounts can be suspended if law enforcement believe individuals are at risk of harm. Police Chief Jim Johnson has said their decision to request a de-activation was based upon the fact Gaines had a gun and a child was present during her standoff with officers. Gaines' social media accounts have been restored. But two videos are missing and are being withheld for violating Facebook's standards - which include a provision against inciting violence. Videos posted on Gaines' Instagram appear to show her talking to her son during the standoff. In one clip, Gaines questions her son about the situation unfolding outside, with a police officer visible through her open door. \"What [are the police] trying to do?\" she asks the boy. \"They're trying to kill us,' he replies. Officers claim Gaines threatened to shoot them if they entered her apartment and that she fired shots several times. Gaines' mother, Rhonda Dormeus, told The Baltimore Sun her daughter ignored pleas to surrender. Ms Dormeus believes she might have been able to help calm her and end the situation peacefully had she been allowed to speak with her. Gaines had a history of mental health problems, including anxiety, her former doctor said in an interview. \"I do feel like they didn't want to hurt her,\" Ms Dormeus said, referring to the police. \"But I don't feel like they exhausted all the means of negotiation.\" The initial warrant for Gaines' arrest related to a traffic stop charge dating back to March."

Gylfi Sigurdsson and Andre Ayew have been linked with moves away from the Liberty Stadium, but Taylor says the club will not need to sell their stars. \"Teams don't have to sell like they used to,\" said Wales' Taylor. \"I think what you're going to find is that with the money coming to the Premier League teams don't have to sell. That might mean a few more clubs hanging on to their best players.\" Swansea head coach Francesco Guidolin has said he expects interest in midfielder Sigurdsson this summer. The 26-year-old Iceland international won Swansea City's supporters' and players' player of the year awards after scoring 11 goals in the club's successful fight against relegation. He is under contract at Swansea until 2018, but has been linked with a number of big clubs, while Ayew has said his future depends on a summer discussion with chairman Huw Jenkins. \"It's the same every year for our club, we have players that come through, they do well,\" said Taylor, who was visiting his old school Ysgol Brynhyfryd in Ruthin before joining up with the Wales squad for their training camp in Portugal. \"Gylfi is someone that has come now in two spells and done well for us. We want to keep hold of them obviously, Andre has scored goals. \"But just like when we lost Wilfried Bony and people down the years and we lost Sigurdsson the last time, we do lose important players because they get poached by bigger teams. \"It's important that we try and keep them and add to that this season because we've realised how hard it is.\" Swansea have been linked with summer moves for two of their former players - Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony and Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen. Ivory Coast international Bony joined City from Swansea for \u00a325m in 2015, while Allen left for Liverpool for \u00a315m in 2012. Both have struggled to nail down starting places at the north-west clubs and Taylor admits he would be delighted to see them return to west Wales. \"There is a lot more work to be done than just somebody to say that we want them back. You have to talk about money, you have to talk about whether the players want to come back here,\" Taylor said. \"They are both at big football clubs that are fighting for trophies, like Liverpool in the Europa League. There's a lot more to happen before we bring those players in but people of that ilk are definitely people that we should be looking at.\""

An NLD spokesman said she would meet China's president, Xi Jinping, and premier, Li Keqiang. Relations between the countries have cooled in recent years, partly because of violence near their mutual border. Myanmar has been fighting rebels in its eastern Kokang region, which borders China's Yunnan province. At least five people in Yunnan died in March when an aircraft from Myanmar, also known as Burma, dropped a bomb on a sugar cane field. China sent patrols to the border in response. While Myanmar's military junta was under Western sanctions, and Ms Suu Kyi was under house arrest, China remained a loyal ally. But since reforms were introduced in 2011, the government of President Thein Sein has allied itself closely with the United States, although China continues to help develop major infrastructure projects in Myanmar. As head of the NLD, Ms Suu Kyi is expected to play a key role in Myanmar's presidential elections this November, although she is unlikely to be able to stand for president. She is fighting to overturn a clause in the constitution that currently blocks her from standing as a candidate. Inviting Ms Suu Kyi is an acknowledgement by the Chinese that, after the Burmese general election later this year, she's likely to be a political force they can no longer ignore. The trip will also pose a moral dilemma for the Burmese opposition leader. Just like Ms Suu Kyi two decades ago, Chinese writer Liu Xiabo has been detained for his pro-democracy activities - and then, like her, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Will Ms Suu Kyi say anything while in China about her fellow Nobel laureate? Or will she choose to remain silent to avoid embarrassing her hosts?"

Mr Soros made huge profits in 1992's \"Black Wednesday\" by betting against the British pound as it crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Before Friday's vote he warned of a similar meltdown, predicting a Brexit victory would send the pound down by 15-20%. In the event, sterling fell about 10% to a 31-year low. \"Now the catastrophic scenario that many feared has materialised, making the disintegration of the EU practically irreversible,\" wrote Mr Soros in his latest article. \"The financial markets worldwide are likely to remain in turmoil as the long, complicated process of political and economic divorce from the EU is negotiated.\" He said the consequences for the economy would be comparable to the financial crisis of 2007-2008. \"After Brexit, all of us who believe in the values and principles that the EU was designed to uphold must band together to save it by thoroughly reconstructing it,\" he wrote. \"I am convinced that as the consequences of Brexit unfold in the weeks and months ahead, more and more people will join us.\" Brexit: What happens now?"

Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. \"Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?\" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was \"taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria\". He said there was now \"more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria\". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region. Turkish officials said they had not been warned promptly enough by British police to intercept them - Scotland Yard denied this."

The main contributor to growth was streaming, but vinyl revenues rose by more than two thirds. However, more revenues could be generated by platforms such as Youtube, the BPI said. Revenue from physical formats dipped below \u00a3300m last year, but remained just above the \u00a3274m generated by streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer. Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the Brit Awards, said the increase in revenues was encouraging, as more and more consumers enjoyed the benefits of subscribing to a streaming service or rediscovered the joys of vinyl. \"Britain's world-leading music sector has the potential for sustained growth in the years ahead, but this exciting future can only be realised if government makes creative businesses a priority post-Brexit,\" he added. UK artists needed to be able to tour freely in EU markets, and UK businesses needed to be able to employ the best talent, Mr Taylor argued. He added that strong intellectual property protections would need to be included in trade talks with third party countries. An International Trade spokeswoman said: \"Music is one of our most important exports and trade policy has a key role in supporting growth in this market. \"We will in due course explore all options in the design of future trade agreements, including the role of intellectual property rights in boosting UK exports in overseas markets.\" Streaming revenues jumped more than 60% in 2016, and accounted for close to a third of label revenues. The BPI said streaming would overtake revenues from physical sales in 2017. However, the association added that there was a \"growing mismatch between the huge value that certain digital platforms, such as YouTube, extract from music or other entertainment and the relatively small amount they return back to the creators concerned\". A YouTube spokesperson said it was working \"with the music industry to bring more money to artists, labels and publishers\". She said that YouTube had paid out more than $1bn to the music industry globally from advertising in the past year. \"YouTube is contributing a meaningful and growing revenue stream for the industry.\" However, many argue that the Google-owned video site should pay out far more revenue to artists and songwriters."

He had been helped to the hospital by friends after being attacked on Edward Street. Det Sgt Julie Connor said it was a \"brutal attack\" with an unknown motive. \"What we do know from the doctors is that the victim is lucky to by alive and if his friends had not intervened, he would probably have died from blood loss,\" she said. The man's attacker was described as being white, in his early 20s, and of average height and slim build, with brown hair cut in a 1960s style and a scruffy beard or moustache. He was said to be wearing a blue top with a circle emblem on the front and blue jeans, and was carrying a large carving knife. Det Sgt Connor said anyone with information about the attack should contact police."

The swan had been shot through the wing with an arrow which narrowly missed its vital organs and spine. It underwent emergency surgery and was on antibiotics and painkillers until its release on 13 April. The swan was cared for at the Scottish SPCA's national wildlife rescue centre in Fishcross and was released at a protected site on the River Tay. Manager Colin Seddon said: \"Once her wounds were healing and she was feeding well she went on to a wet pool and once given the all clear by our vet she went outside into one of our swan paddocks where she was able to join another recuperating swan. \"Being a flock animal, swans do much better when kept with other swans. \"After a week outside and once the weather conditions were suitable, she was released along with her new companion at a privately owned nature reserve on the River Tay, where the wild swans are support fed until they choose to disperse and go their own way.\" Insp Sarah Gregory, of the Scottish SPCA, said: \"Sadly the swan's mate was found dead at the same time but we have recently received the results of a post-mortem which do not show anything linking the death to intentional trauma or a bow and arrow attack. \"Despite our public appeal following the cruel and mindless attack on the female swan, we have not yet traced the perpetrator and we would still urge anyone with information to come forward.\""

Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds. Uhuru Kenyatta Raila Odinga Profile: Uhuru Kenyatta Profile: Raila Odinga Some electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns. At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready. Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this. Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report. Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision. \"We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,\" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. But the election commission now says a decision on what to do about the spoiled ballots will be taken after all other votes are counted, our correspondent reports.

Government forces, backed by Russian allies, took nearly all remaining rebel-held parts of Aleppo this week. It represents a major victory for President Bashar al-Assad. He hailed the \"liberation\" of Aleppo and said history was being made. Global solidarity over Aleppo How Srebrenica's survivors view Aleppo What's happening in Aleppo? What happens next? The evacuation of civilians, rebels and their families had been due to take place on Wednesday but an earlier ceasefire deal collapsed. \"Some 3,000 civilians and more than 40 wounded, including children, were brought out,\" the head of the ICRC in Syria, Marianne Gasser, said after two convoys left. \"No-one knows how many people are left in the east, and the evacuation could take days,\" she added. The evacuees are being transferred to rebel-held areas in neighbouring Idlib province. US Secretary of State John Kerry meanwhile accused Syrian leaders of carrying out \"nothing short of a massacre\" in Aleppo and urged them to return to peace talks in Geneva. \"The only remaining question is whether the Syrian regime, with Russia's support, is willing to go to Geneva prepared to negotiate constructively, and whether or not they're willing to stop this slaughter of their own people,\" he said in Washington. John Kerry expressed moral outrage at the fate of Aleppo and he stressed that the Syrian regime was responsible for the failure of a year's worth of US-Russian negotiations aimed at a nationwide ceasefire and peace talks. But he didn't offer any new plan to end the conflict. Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy. \"You can't make someone do something through diplomacy that they're not prepared to negotiate,\" he told me. Critics in Washington, though, have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force, giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith. Some have faulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia's willingness for a deal - \"delusional diplomacy\", the Washington Post called it. Mr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal. But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the waning weeks of this administration, and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one. Syrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city. A statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria, part of Russia's ministry of defence, said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo. The rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03:00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed.

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: \"China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. \"Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment.\" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. \"We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places.\" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was \"a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today\". \"We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,\" he added. \"And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party.\" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: \"It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. \"The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter"

      "text": "Swedish prosecutors issued a European arrest warrant for Mr Assange after allegations of sexual assault related to a 2010 visit Mr Assange made to Stockholm to give a lecture. He denies the claims. These are the key dates: Below is more information on how events have unfolded: Julian Assange arrives in Sweden on a speaking trip partly arranged by \"Miss A\", a member of the Christian Association of Social Democrats. He has not met \"Miss A\" before but reports suggest they have arranged in advance that he can stay in her apartment while she is out of town for a few days. \"Miss A\" and Mr Assange attend a seminar by the Social Democrats' Brotherhood Movement on \"War and the role of media\", at which the Wikileaks founder is the key speaker. The two reportedly have sex that night. Mr Assange reportedly has sex with a woman he met at the seminar on 14 August, identified as \"Miss W\". Some time between 17 and 20 August, \"Miss W\" and \"Miss A\" are in contact and apparently share with a journalist the concerns they have about aspects of their respective sexual encounters with Mr Assange. Mr Assange applies for a residence permit to live and work in Sweden. He hopes to create a base for Wikileaks there, because of the country's laws protecting whistle-blowers. The Swedish Prosecutor's Office issues an arrest warrant for Mr Assange on allegations of rape and molestation. Both women reportedly say that what started as consensual sex became non-consensual. Wikileaks quotes Mr Assange as saying the accusations are \"without basis\" and that their appearance \"at this moment is deeply disturbing\". A later message on the Wikileaks Twitter feed says the group has been warned to expect \"dirty tricks\". The arrest warrant is withdrawn. \"I don't think there is reason to suspect that he has committed rape,\" says one of Stockholm's chief prosecutors, Eva Finne. Prosecutors say the investigation into the molestation allegation will continue but it is not a serious enough crime for an arrest warrant. The lawyer for the two women, Claes Borgstrom, lodges an appeal to a special department in the public prosecutions office. Mr Assange is questioned by police in Stockholm and formally told of the allegations against him, according to his lawyer at the time, Leif Silbersky. The activist denies the allegations. Swedish Director of Prosecution Marianne Nye says she is reopening the rape investigation against Mr Assange. \"Considering information available at present, my judgement is that the classification of the crime is rape.\" The Wikileaks founder is denied residency in Sweden. No reason is given, although an official on Sweden's Migration Board tells the AFP news agency \"he did not fulfil the requirements\". Stockholm District Court approves a request to detain Mr Assange for questioning on suspicion of rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion. Ms Nye says he has not been available for questioning. By this time Mr Assange has travelled to London. His British lawyer, Mark Stephens, says his client offered to be interviewed at the Swedish embassy in London or Scotland Yard"

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled \u00a34.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further \u00a3500m in cash terms this year, it said. \"Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional \u00a31.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,\" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. \"What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,\" ADASS president Ray James said. \"In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing.\" ADASS called for the government to \"protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community\". But a government spokesman said the survey \"ignores\" a commitment to invest \u00a310bn in health services that are being \"joined up\" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The \"care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\". \"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. \"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further \u00a31bn coming out of social care budgets was \"chilling\". Sue Brown, vice chairman of the Care and Support Alliance - which represents 80 leading charities - said"

Sales jumped from \u20ac9.4bn to \u20ac10.5bn, an increase of 11%. The group's clothes can now be bought online in around 40 countries, it said. Inditex operates eight brands in 90 countries including Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti and Bershka. How Zara's founder became the richest man in the world - for two days Chairman and chief executive Pablo Isla emphasised the firm's investment in technology, saying the firm had expanded its online stores to 11 new countries in the period. It also launched mobile phone payment in all its Spanish stores, with the objective of \"extending the service to other countries\". This will encompass online apps for all of its brands and a specific app for the whole group called InWallet. Mr Isla said: \"Both our online and bricks-and-mortar stores are seamlessly connected, driven by platforms such as mobile payment, and other technological initiatives that we will continue to develop.\" Tom Gadsby, an analyst at Liberum, said the firm's \"online drive\" was important. \"I expect over the years they may find they don't have to open as many stores to maintain their strong growth rate as the online channel will become increasingly important,\" he said. \"And while Zara is available in many of the territories in which they operate [online], most of their other brands aren't readily available outside Europe online. \"So there is a big opportunity there for them to expand online into new territories.\" The company also said it had benefited from steady economic growth in Spain, where Inditex gets about a fifth of its sales. That country's clothing market grew at an average of 3% in the three-months to the end of July, according to the Spanish statistics agency. All of the group's brands increased their international presence during the period, with 83 new stores opened in 38 countries. In a call with analysts, it said it would open 6-8% of new store space over course of the year. The firm's strong performance sets it apart from European rivals H&M and Next, which have blamed unseasonal weather for below-forecast results this year."

Wales wing North, 24, is one of four Lions making their first appearances of the tour in Canterbury. \"It's all about building for the Test series but we need to start kicking on now,\" North said. \"After this everyone will have had some game time so everyone's foot is in the door and playing now and I think we can kick on.\" North scored two tries in the 2013 series which saw the Lions beat Australia 2-1 - their first Test series win in 16 years. The Northampton Saints player sat out the opening two matches along with centre Jonathan Davies, scrum-half Conor Murray and flanker Sean O'Brien. Media playback is not supported on this device North said he was carrying a \"bump\" when he arrived in New Zealand, but admits it was not easy watching from the sidelines. \"The Lions is the pinnacle and to not feature in the first two games is annoying because, like anybody, you just want to play,\" added North. \"But it's just part of touring isn't it? It's the bigger picture now, I knew I'd get my game time as and when and I just have to trust the medical staff and trust Gats [coach Warren Gatland] to make those calls and just be ready for it.\" Crusaders are the form team in Super Rugby this season, with 14 wins in as many matches and field a team including eight All Blacks against the Lions. North said the quality of the opposition has been no surprise to the tourists and believes it is better to be tested early on the tour than have the relatively easy introduction they had in Australia four years ago. \"We always knew the first few games were going to be ropey and not how we want to play,\" said North. \"And I think that was evident in 2013 as well, even though at the same stage we'd won two out of two the performances were not what we'd hoped for. \"I think the way we are now is probably better. \"You want to be tested in every game don't you?

The hospital involved has categorically rejected the family's claims. The woman's burial has been postponed while further investigations are carried out. Milluzzo was admitted to Cannizzaro hospital in the Sicilian city of Catania on 29 September after suffering complications and going into premature labour in her 19th week of pregnancy. She had had fertility treatment at another health centre. She was in a stable condition in hospital for more than a fortnight but on 15 October her blood pressure and temperature dropped and her condition worsened. According to the family's lawyer, one of the foetuses was suffering breathing problems. The lawyer alleges that the gynaecologist refused to abort the foetuses in order to save the mother and said: \"As long as it's alive, I will not intervene.\" No action was taken while the troubled foetus was still alive and hours later both had died, the lawyer said. Overnight, the mother's condition deteriorated and she contracted an infection. On 16 October she was transferred to intensive care, where she died. Angelo Pellicano, the head of the Cannizzaro hospital, said the lawyer was wrong. \"There was no conscientious objection on behalf of the doctor that intervened in this case because there was no voluntary termination of the pregnancy, but (the miscarriage) was forced by the grave circumstances,\" he told the Ansa news agency. \"I rule out that a doctor could have told the family what they say he told them.\" Sources told Ansa that the doctor had not been registered as a \"conscientious objector\". Catania's prosecutor has halted Milluzzo's burial while a post mortem examination is carried out. There are unconfirmed reports that some of the hospital's medical staff may be investigated. A senior doctor at the hospital, Paolo Scollo, told the Corriere website that all the doctors in his department were \"objectors\", and external doctors were called in when necessary. \"However, in this case we're talking about a spontaneous miscarriage, no external help was needed. So we do not think the doctor was negligent,\" he said. It emerged earlier this year that the proportion of Italian gynaecologists refusing to carry out abortions in 2013 was 70%, according to Italian government figures. Italy is a predominantly Catholic country. But in southern Italy the proportion was even higher and in Sicily it was 87.6%. Abortion has been legal in Italy since 1978, provided it is during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. After 12 weeks it is allowed only if the life of the mother is at risk or there is a problem with a foetus. If there is a chance the foetus can survive outside the womb, termination is lawful only if pregnancy or delivery is a serious risk to the woman's health.

We need to give back as much as we receive. \"It is a big match but there is a long way to go in this league. \"Our job is to concentrate on our own game and just get on with the task ahead of us.\" Earlier in the campaign, Crusaders won 1-0 away to the Reds while the north Belfast rivals drew 2-2 at Seaview on Boxing Day. \"We have been on a good run for some time now,\" said Cliftonville manager Lyttle whose side beat Ards in last weekend's League Cup final. \"We had a wee blip with a number of draws but we have got things sorted out and are a team in form. \"Hopefully, we can drive on for the rest of the campaign.\" Victory for Cliftonville would also be a boost to Linfield's ambitions of being the ones to deny Crusaders back-to-back titles. David Healy's Blues, who lost 2-1 at Portadown last time out, go to Coleraine aiming to beat the Bannsiders for the third time this season. \"We had been on a nice little run before the Portadown game,\" said boss Healy. \"Portadown had been struggling but they have now taken six points from us.

Relatives of L/Cpl Craig Roberts, 24, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy, paid tribute saying he had died \"in the pursuit of his dream\". Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced a full inquiry. We, Craig's family, would like to thank all our and Craig's friends for their kind thoughts and support. We are all devastated at the loss of our beloved Craig; this has left a massive hole in all our lives. We wholeheartedly supported Craig in his military endeavours and it gives us some comfort, though great sadness, that he died in the pursuit of his dream. Next month Craig was due to start a new post in the office of the secretary of state for education and we were all very proud of him. We would like to thank the Ministry of Defence family liaison officer for all his help and support in these trying times. Speaking to Channel 4 news, Mr Capstick described how he was walking in the Beacons when he was passed by a line of soldiers moving in the opposite direction at five or 10-minute intervals. \"We then came across two soldiers who had clearly broken that intended mode of operation and were proceeding slowly together, and one of the soldiers made a compassionate plea for some drinking water for his colleague,\" he said. \"He was upset,\" he added. \"The other soldier was trying to make the best of the situation and asked if we could spare any water for his colleague, not for himself.\" Mr Capstick added that it \"certainly was slightly odd\" that the two soldiers in particular had bunched together and were \"clearly in distress.\" In a statement issued through the Ministry of Defence, Mr Roberts's father Kelvin said: \"We are all devastated at the loss of our beloved Craig; this has left a massive hole in all our lives.\" He said he had died \"in the pursuit of his dream\". Mr Roberts, who had worked as a teaching assistant in London, was due to take up a job in Whitehall in the office of Education Secretary Michael Gove. He had served with the Territorial Army (TA) for more than five years and was a member of the 3rd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment. It is believed he served as a reservist in Iraq and Afghanistan, and had taken part in several exercises including a training mission in Texas with the American National Guard. He had taken part in a four-week trial for the TA SAS reservists ending in a 40-mile (64km) hike over the Brecon Beacons. L/Cpl Roberts was described as being \"the salt of the earth\" by one friend, who added that the soldier was \"extremely dedicated\".

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Friday admitted using \"creative\" strategies to stop migrant boats but refused to go into detail. The country's immigration and foreign ministers denied payments were made. \"The boat that was rescued by the Indonesian navy on 31 May - we have interviewed the 65 passengers and they have said that the crew received a payment,\" said Mr Lynch. He said the passengers - 54 from Sri Lanka, 10 from Bangladesh, and one from Myanmar - were transferred to a customs boat for four days \"before being put on two boats and sent back to Indonesia\". He added: \"Mr Abbott says the reason is to save lives because people risk their lives on the boats, and I agree, but I'm not sure putting them back on boats and sending them back is the answer.\" Mr Lynch said Australia had a responsibility under UN treaties, which it had signed, to see if any of the migrants were in need of international protection. He accused Australia of \"sending the wrong signal\" to other countries in the region - including Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand - which the UN is trying to persuade to allow migrants to disembark. Indonesia's foreign ministry said it was \"very concerned\" about the alleged payment. The Indonesian navy said it intercepted the boats on their return and arrested the crew, who said they had each been paid A$5,000 ($3,900; \u00c2\u00a32,500) to turn back. Local police chief Hidayat told AFP news agency: \"I saw the money with my own eyes.\" Speaking to Radio 3AW on Friday morning, Mr Abbott refused to deny that a payment had been made, saying simply that \"creative strategies\" had been developed to stop the migrant boats. \"We have stopped the trade and we will do what we have to do to ensure that it stays stopped,\" he said. Under Australia's controversial policies, no migrants and asylum seekers are allowed to reach its territories by boat. They are instead intercepted at sea and turned back or taken to detention facilities on the island nation of Nauru and on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Australia asylum: Why is it controversial?"

It was answerable to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL), whose oversight prior to its downfall in 2007 is described as being close to non-existent. The department's then permanent secretary, Paul Sweeney, has already apologised and accepted responsibility for what happened. The PAC report notes that no DCAL official has ever been disciplined. The report said the NIEC board's performance \"in key areas was extraordinarily weak\" and questioned whether all its members were fully motivated.

It will be signed between the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the South African Development Community (SADC) and the East African Community (EAC). Now there's been great fanfare in the press about this, mainly pushed by the politicians who are made to look good by this kind of thing. But the headlines of \"Common Market for Africa\" or \"EU-style bloc emerges in Africa\" are misleading. If the TFTA functions properly, it will be a free trade area, not a common market and certainly nothing approaching what the EU is. The trouble is not all the players involved function properly themselves. COMESA still has certain tariffs within it, while inside the EAC (arguably the most integrated of the blocs) there are still issues between Kenya and Tanzania on things like share ownership. And South Africa tends to dominate SADC. But that's not to say that this tripartite agreement is a waste of time. Free trade from Cape to Cairo has been a goal since colonial times (Cecil Rhodes talked about it) and this agreement is a baby step towards that. In theory, it'll boost intra-African trade, but that depends more on the capacity of African countries to make what each other want at competitive prices, rather than a simple lowering or scrapping of tariffs between the 26 members. The devil will be in the details of this agreement. There have been concerns over protectionist measures for local industries and a method of settling trade disputes. But it may boost intra-Africa trade. At the moment, trade between African countries amounts to just 13% of total African trade. Some academics have said that this tripartite agreement could boost it by 30% over the next few years. But there will be challenges on the ground. For a start, customs officials and getting across borders is notoriously cumbersome in Africa. Also, manufacturing on a local level needs to be boosted. The UN said three years ago that the best way to boost African trade was to concentrate on developing local capacity, rather than just lowering tariffs. That way, Africans would have things to sell to each other at prices that are more competitive than outsiders. If that happens within a new free trade area, that's what would boost intra-African trade. Also there are various disputes between the members of this agreement, from gripes to outright hostility. So, while there's a good deal of political will behind the TFTA, how it works on the ground will be the proof of the pudding. And that won't be apparent for months or years to come. Pardon my cynicism, but the three blocs involved in this are by no means functioning perfectly. With all the hype surrounding this TFTA, you'd think it was the panacea to all of Africa's economic and trade problems. It's not. But it is a tiny step in the right direction."

Most of the Russian-language report, entitled Putin. War, is based on facts that have already appeared in Russian and foreign media since Crimea was annexed in March 2014 and conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine. But its authors say putting the facts together and describing the human and economic cost of the conflict makes a very compelling case for accusing President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends. Russia has consistently denied accusations that it has sent regular troops and armour to help rebels in eastern Ukraine, arguing that any Russians serving there are \"volunteers\". But Mr Yashin, who presented the report, said Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive to securing all major victories claimed by the pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk. \"All the separatists' key successes were secured by Russian army units,\" he said. \"The soldiers directly admit they were directed on to Ukraine territory, admit that they were brought there to take part in a war operation. There is no doubt they did not end up there by accident.\" The dossier presents evidence of volunteer soldiers who admit that it was Russian generals, not separatists, who directed the main battles in eastern Ukraine. A Russian army veteran, described as helping to enlist volunteers, says they are not doing it for nothing: salaries can reach $2,000-3,000 (\u00c2\u00a31,250-1,900) a month. Russian spending on the conflict is calculated at 53bn roubles (\u00c2\u00a3665m; $1bn): Boris Nemtsov began work on the report early this year, after hearing that the relatives of dead Russian soldiers had not been given promised compensation. But those relatives never went public and, after his assassination, have become even more scared. Names and numbers of military units are documented, along with photos of weaponry, although activists point out these are harder to verify without knowing where they were taken. How many Russians are fighting in Ukraine? BBC team attacked while investigating soldiers' deaths Russian families look for soldier sons Mr Yashin said the opposition would seek donations to extend the initial print run of only 2,000 copies. But publishing and distributing this kind of dossier is hard work. Many publishers were afraid to work with this material, he said. And above all, the question remains: How many people are keen to learn the facts which for months have been available on the internet and the few liberal media that remain in Russia? There are plenty of Russians aware of their country's involvement in eastern Ukraine, who nevertheless find it acceptable, because they believe Moscow is supporting those who wish to be independent of the government in Kiev. But the opposition does not see it as support. It accuses President Putin of masterminding and directing the war to boost his failing popularity. In this, they admit he was successful. And it is entirely possible their report may well see the same fate as earlier works published by the late Boris Nemtsov. Critics of"

His lawyer said he had managed to pay back the cash in full by selling property he owned, but a sheriff said the scam was too serious for him to avoid jail. Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: \"The business owned by the accused is involved in the sale of fish, which is zero-rated for VAT. \"As a result, the accused is lawfully entitled to claim back any VAT incurred by him in the expenses involved in the sale of this fish. \"All invoices showed exorbitant levels of haulage costs being claimed by him against his alleged purchase of huge quantities of fish. \"The accused's computer was later analysed and it was uncovered that these false invoices had in fact been created by the accused on it before he had submitted them on to his accountants and induced them to make the false claim on his behalf.\" Defence solicitor David Bell said: \"It appears the haulage company were not charging VAT and he was assuming it was included and was claiming it back. \"He then realised they were not adding VAT and he spotted the loophole and then exploited it over a lengthy period. \"He employs six people in the business and fears it will fold without him as he is heavily involved.\" Sheriff Alastair Carmichael jailed Fleming saying: \"This was a fraud carried out by you on public funds, so it was a fraud on the whole community.\""

He had previously opposed an assisted dying law, but said his illness has left him \"like a beached whale\" and in constant discomfort. \"My position has changed,\" he wrote to Baroness D'Souza. Stage and TV actor Lord Rix, who specialised in post-war \"Whitehall farce\" comedies, is receiving 24-hour care in a retirement home. \"My position has changed. As a dying man, who has been dying now for several weeks, I am only too conscious that the laws of this country make it impossible for people like me to be helped on their way, even though the family is supportive of this position and everything that needs to be done has been dealt with. \"Unhappily, my body seems to be constructed in such a way that it keeps me alive in great discomfort when all I want is to be allowed to slip into a sleep, peacefully, legally and without any threat to the medical or nursing profession. \"I am sure there are many others like me who having finished with life wish their life to finish. \"Only with a legal euthanasia Bill on the statute books will the many people who find themselves in the same situation as me be able to slip away peacefully in their sleep instead of dreading the night.\" The crossbench peer voted against an Assisted Dying Bill in 2006 because of concerns that people with learning disabilities might become the unwilling victims of euthanasia. He has been a prominent campaigner for people with learning disabilities after his daughter was born with Down's syndrome. He said his children were \"absolutely supportive\" of his decision and that he has \"wrapped up\" his affairs and was \"ready to go\" to \"put an end to this misery, pain and discomfort\". \"I can't do anything but lie here thinking 'Oh Christ, why am I still here?' They won't let me die and that's all I want to do,\" he said. He added the doctors and nurses \"do their best for me\" but that it was \"not good enough because what I want is to die, and the law stops them from helping me with that\". He had discussed with his children the possibility of travelling to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, but felt it would be \"unfair to them to push them into a situation where they are helping me to die\". Lord Rix said he had not been given an estimate from doctors as to how long he will live, adding: \"I think it's wrong that people like me are stranded like this. \"I'm not looking for something that helps me only, I'm thinking of all the other people who must be in the same dreadful position.\" Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

After the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and the tragedy of the Beijing massacre in 1989, young people are not allowed to demonstrate in China. But some now hound their enemies online. The underlying rage is reminiscent. The instinct for intimidation is the same. Despite all its strengths and all its engagement with the world, China is once again prey to political groupthink and fear. The latest trigger is a speech by a Chinese student at an American campus. On 21 May, at an official event, Shuping Yang praised the fresh air and freedom of speech she had found at the University of Maryland. The video clip of her speech quickly went viral and triggered an outpouring of anger from fellow Chinese students in the US and critics at home. Shuping Yang swiftly apologised, asked forgiveness and said she had no intention to belittle her country. But that was not enough to stop the flood of \"I am proud of China\" posts accusing her of lies and deception, or the online \"human flesh searches\" to dig up incriminating information about her and her family. Of course there are good reasons to be proud of China and every Chinese citizen is entitled to list them. In the past week alone, China has sent a submersible deep into the Mariana Trench and its world champion go player Ke Jie took on the AlphaGo AI computer programme and almost beat it. Every day ordinary Chinese people display the energy, talent and hard work of which their fellow citizens should be proud. But being proud of China does not mean denying another Chinese citizen the right to an opinion. In fact, Shuping Yang herself said she too was proud in her message of apology. The irony is that the very backlash against her has only served to make her point about the want of freedom of speech in her homeland. It has also highlighted a conflict between a commitment to free speech in Western countries that host large communities of Chinese students and the growing determination of the Chinese government and some of its citizens that free speech should be limited when it comes to talking about China, even beyond Chinese borders. Freedom of speech is any society's feedback loop. It means precisely the freedom to say what is different or what may even offend. Of course, different societies have a different view on how much of this is appropriate. But if China's freedom of speech goes no further than parroting the leader and attacking those who dare to speak from a different script, then its spirit is lurking in the shadow of the Mao era. Which brings us to Chairman Xi and his style of leadership. In English Xi Jinping is usually referred to as President Xi. But his power comes from being leader of the Communist Party and since taking up that role five years ago, he has collapsed the distinction between party and government and dramatically shrunk the space for"

Grammy members will also vote in fewer categories, the Recording Academy announced. The changes will come into force in time for next February's awards. Bill Freimuth, the Academy's senior vice president of awards, said: \"We noticed that there were a number of higher-profile artists who were choosing - for philosophical reasons as much as anything - to release their music through streaming-only, and we did not want to be exclusionary toward them.\" Some musicians, including Prince and Beyonce, have released debuts exclusively on Tidal, before then releasing them on iTunes and other platforms. Grammy members will also have the number of categories they can vote in reduced from 20 to 15. However all members will still be able to vote in the top four categories: album of the year, song of the year, record of the year and best new artist. Other changes include an update for the best new artist category. Rules now allow a performer who releases at least five singles to qualify. Previously, acts had to release an album to be eligible. Acts can qualify for best new artist until they have released three albums or 30 singles. The best rap/sung collaboration, which was given to rap and R&B acts who team up on a track, is being renamed to best rap/sung performance, and can now be given to solo acts. Best blues album has also been split into two categories: best traditional blues album and best contemporary blues album. Freimuth added: \"The effort here is to protect the integrity of the Grammy Awards, and so sometimes that means typing up some rules, and sometimes that means loosening up some rules, sometimes that means contracting a category, sometimes that means adding a category.\" This year's awards saw Taylor Swift's 1989 win the coveted album of the year award. The singer - who is the first woman to win the award twice - also won best pop vocal album and best music video, for her track Bad Blood. Rapper Kendrick Lamar won the most prizes on the night with five awards. British singer Ed Sheeran also won his first two Grammys for song of the year and best pop solo performance, for his number one hit Thinking Out Loud. Songs need to have been released between 1 October 2015 and 30 September 2016 to be eligible for next year's awards. The nominations will be announced on 6 December."

It will mean a decrease from \u00a34 for a two-hour period to \u00a31. Clive Coleman, RCA contracts director at City of Derry Airport, has said the move was \"not to increase revenues\". He said the fee would reduce congestion and was in response to an increase in traffic incidents. \"The level of abuse is of deep concern to the airport's management team and the board of directors and is at a level that can no longer be tolerated,\" Mr Coleman said. Members of the public will need to pay a \u00a31 fee to enter the car park and would be permitted to stay for a two-hour period. The changes will be introduced on 1 December 2015. Former chairman of the airport users committee James Buchanan, welcomed the change. \"There have been a number of complaints about taking away the 10 minutes free parking,\" Mr Buchanan said. \"There are all sorts of people saying that this is the City of Derry trying to raise more money. \"But in reality, 10 minutes was too short for a number of people. \"I have talked to staff a number of times and I know they do get a lot of abuse from people when they have run over the 10 minutes and find that they can't get out in the 10-minute period.\" The Consumer Council has said they had not yet received any formal complaints about the plans. \"Whilst this is disappointing coming into the Christmas period, we also recognise the airport's safety concerns,\" said the Consumer Council's head of transport policy Scott Kennerley. \"We welcome the news that short stay prices are being reduced from \u00a34 to \u00a31 for a two-hour stay. \"This should be beneficial if there are flight delays and allow people to meet passengers inside the airport terminal building.\""

His brother Mike has been travelling the country spreading a message of religious tolerance and understanding. He urged UK communities to \"extend the hand of friendship\" to those in need. David Haines, who grew up in Perth, was abducted while working as an aid worker in Syria, and held hostage for 18 months before a video of his murder was posted online. The 44-year-old father of two's brother Mike has since worked with charities, community groups and religious leaders across the country. He said: \"Right from the day David was taken, we were aware as a family that the chances of him coming out were not good. \"When he appeared in the video, we knew that it was going to end. I thought that day was the worst day of my life. \"It was devastating, it really was a terrible night. \"It's one of those things, you could either let it destroy you, or carry on.\" Mr Haines has met the Pope and travelled to the Middle East as he continues his brother's work to spread messages of unity, tolerance and peace. He said he had no hatred for young people radicalised by extremism, and said his brother's life \"wasn't about hating\". He said: \"Those poor youths, the girls and boys who get twisted into going out there and given a false reality, I have no hate for them. \"Those people who are behind it and planning it, it's a little bit different. \"There's a part of me, when I look back at the relationship that David and I had, that could hate. \"But my brother's life wasn't about hating. Rather than hate these people, let's bring love and compassion and tolerance and understanding to those people that they are affecting. \"They took my brother's life, but they are killing thousands of people in the most barbaric of ways. My brother is just one among many.\" Mr Haines said the government and communities in the UK had a \"duty\" to extend the hand of friendship and help those in need in countries affected by extremism. He said: \"It is a measure of our humanity, how much humanity we show them. They are in real danger, and real need. \"For me, it's our duty that we do help. As communities, as cities, as councils, we all have a role to play. \"They will be coming into our communities, and what's more effective than what the British government does as an entity is the hand that we give to them in friendship.\" Mr Haines is set to embark on a tour of Scotland as part of his campaign to counteract hatred and intolerance."

He was also ordered to carry out 150 hours' unpaid work at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court. District judge Susan Williams also ordered him to pay \u00c2\u00a3145 in costs and charges. She said that, although Carlisle had made a \"positive contribution\" to others through football, she had to sentence him for the risk his \"erratic\" driving had created. \"If you are not in control of your vehicle in a road in central London you represent a danger to people,\" she said. At a hearing in March, the court heard Carlisle's Mercedes had been spotted \"swerving\" and \"almost mounting the pavement\" in Pentonville Road. After his arrest, the court heard, he refused to give a breath sample and demanded to speak to his solicitor. Lisa Judge, defending, said he allowed the matter to \"escalate out of all control\" and \"unfortunately\" believed he had the right to see a lawyer, instead of being breathalysed. Carlisle has revealed he attempted to take his own life two days afterwards, when he was hit by a lorry on the A64 near York. Miss Judge described the arrest as having happened while he was \"in an extremely dark place in terms of his own life\". Carlisle is now so sorry about what happened that the court-ordered medical report on him \"utterly oozes remorse\", Miss Judge said. The court was told Carlisle had been involved in \"excess drinking offences\" in 1999 and 2011. He played for teams including Burnley, Queens Park Rangers, Leeds United and Northampton Town and was also the chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association."

And they are all asking each other the same question: \"What time is it?\" The clocks on our phones have reset themselves to French time, and for the surprising number who are not wearing watches, the confusion is palpable. Then the phones start beeping. \"Welcome to France!\" read the incoming text messages. \"Your roaming costs are...\" Inadvertent roaming, as it is called, is surprisingly common in this part of the country, despite France itself being a fair distance away - there are 74 miles (119km) between Poole and Cherbourg, a popular ferry route. Visitors to the surrounding areas, including Portland near Weymouth, can find themselves suddenly connected to French networks, and, if they're not careful, run up their phone bills with every phone call, text and social network update being charged as if it was made from abroad. It's not only a problem along the south coast of England - residents and visitors along the borders of Northern Ireland face substantial issues with their phones connecting to Irish networks, often without them even realising it. In 2012 research carried out there by industry regulator Ofcom found that on average those affected were spending \u00c2\u00a3300 a year each on accidental data roaming, and only 11% of them had thought to switch the service off on the phone itself. The worst affected areas were east and north County Londonderry - notably Portstewart, south County Armagh and south County Down. \"The EU Roaming Regulation requires that mobile operators take reasonable steps to protect their customers from paying roaming charges for inadvertently accessed roaming services while situated in their home member state, and to make information available to their customers on how to avoid inadvertent roaming in border regions,\" said an Ofcom representative. With the EU looking to lower the existing cap on data roaming charges this summer, inadvertent roaming may soon become a less expensive accident - and for local residents it can be something of a mixed blessing. Daff Tambling lives in the popular walkers' haven of Worth Matravers, to the east of Lulworth. The village played a key role in the development of the use of radar during World War Two - but it is no longer a hotspot for communications technology. \"On certain windowsills in certain weather conditions I can just about get enough UK signal to receive a text,\" she said. \"The phone has to stay at the same angle.\" Ms Tambling estimates that most days she will end up with either a French connection - or nothing at all. \"It preserves a stillness - there's something nostalgic and romantic about it. I quite like it on many levels,\" she added. \"But when it gets irritating is when companies are increasingly relying on texting you.

Van den Driessche was competing during the women's under-23 race at the Cyclo-cross World Championships. The motor was hidden, along with a battery, in the tube below the saddle. It was controlled by a Bluetooth switch installed underneath the handlebar tape.

The survey is one of the Earthwatch projects being highlighted at the organisation's annual lecture on Thursday evening in central London. One of the speakers, Dan Bebber - Earthwatch's head of climate change research - will use his presentation to deliver some of the main findings from the survey. During the course of a month in the summer of 2009, volunteers from the charity helped a team of researchers from the University of Oxford mark the wings of more than 13,000 moths. The survey, known as a mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiment, was co-ordinated by Dr Eleanor Slade in conjuction with the university's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU), in a well-researched woodland habitat in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire. More than 650 moths, from 41 species, were recaptured. Dr Bebber said: \"A small percentage of those marked moths were recaptured again, but from the number we did recapture we were able to determine what factors affect the ability of moths to disperse.\" Sea moths: George McGavin sets out to discover how moths migrate The largest recorded distance travelled by a one moth - a broad-bordered yellow underwing - was 13.7km. Dr Bebber said the survey seemed to suggest that woodland species were the most effective when it came to dispersing. \"Relatively large species with pointed wings that preferred woodland landscapes dispersed further than other species,\" he told BBC News. However, he added that even these species did require wooded corridors, such as hedgerows, to disperse and were not found on maiden trees - single trees found in fields. \"The habitats within the UK had been fragmented for a long time,\" Dr Bebber explained. \"It is probably the ones that can move relatively long distances that are still found in the UK. \"Those species that were not able to disperse so well have probably disappeared over millennia.\" Dr Bebber will present his findings at the Earthwatch Institute's annual lecture, Climate Change and Forests, which is being chaired by TV presenter Kate Humble."

The burglary happened at their home in the Turf Hill area at about 05:30 BST on Wednesday, Greater Manchester Police said. The three balaclava-wearing men stole cash, jewellery and a mobile phone before fleeing. The offender carrying the gun, said to be a small silver metal handgun, was described as Asian, slim and aged between 20 and 30. The man with the knife was black, between 30 and 40, of a medium build and with bloodshot eyes. It is believed they were met by three other men outside the property. Police are now appealing for anyone with information to contact them. Det Con Rich Shelton said: \"This gang targeted a mum and her young daughter, even stooping as low as to hold a gun to the head of a woman who was clearly heavily pregnant and absolutely terrified. \"Thankfully they were not physically injured and the unborn baby not harmed but the emotional trauma they have suffered is immeasurable.\""

The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: \"I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her.\" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party. Since the McDonald's murder, public outrage has forced the authorities to increase pressure on the Church of the Almighty God with almost daily arrests and raids."

Mother Teresa died in 1997 and was beatified - the first step towards sainthood - in 2003. She won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work with the poor in the slums of Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta). \"The Holy Father has authorised the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to proclaim the decree concerning the miracle attributed to the intercession of blessed Mother Teresa,\" the Vatican said on Friday. She is expected to be canonised in Rome in September. Beatification by the Catholic Church requires one miracle, while the process of becoming recognised as a saint requires proof of at least two miracles. Mother Teresa was beatified in 2003 after Pope John Paul II accepted as authentic a miracle attributed to her. He judged that the curing of an Indian woman suffering from an abdominal tumour was the result of the supernatural intervention of the late Mother Teresa - a claim challenged by Indian rationalists. There are few details about the recovery of the Brazilian man, whose life the Vatican says was saved in the second miracle. His identity has not been disclosed to maintain the discretion needed for the investigation, the Catholic New Agency has said. It says he was unexpectedly cured from brain tumours in 2008 after his priest prayed for Mother Teresa's intervention with God. Born Agnes Gonxhe Bojaxhiu in Skopje, Macedonia, in 1910, she founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1949, dedicating her life to caring for impoverished and sick people in Kolkata. Known as the \"saint of the gutter\", she earned worldwide acclaim for her efforts. Her critics, however, accused her of mixing with dictators and peddling a hardline Catholicism."

Speaking on the anniversary of the discovery of her body, Det Supt Simon Atkinson said: \"Our Canadian colleagues are doing some ground-breaking forensic work, so we've sent some of the forensic exhibits over to them. \"They have been able to develop a DNA profile which we are really interested in developing further.\" He added: \"It's a leap forward we haven't had in the past 21 years, so I'm really excited about this development.\" Lindsay left her home in Cambridge Street at about 22:00 and visited the Trades Club in Home Street.

Her body, which had been weighted down with a stone, was recovered about a mile upstream from the town centre.

He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an \"embarrassing U-turn\" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought \"divergent and strongly held views\". Mr Davies said to \"avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites\". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. \"We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,\" he said. \"I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. \"If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose.\" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government \"spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response\". He said: \"70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think.\" He added: \"I think there are plenty of people in the fishing industry... that understand that in order to get the best yields from the marine habitats on which they depend, they have to be managed properly.\""

England head coach Jones told BBC Sport that despite having a forwards coach he would \"never close the door\". Jones also said Dylan Hartley would continue to captain England if he was fit enough to be selected. Northampton hooker Hartley is serving a six-week ban for catching Leinster's Sean O'Brien with a swinging arm in a Champions Cup match in December. Jones, 56, said last month that the 30-year-old had \"let his country down\" with the third red card of his career. But the Australian said on Tuesday that Hartley was \"doing everything right\" to be England captain for the forthcoming Six Nations. Cockerill had been a member of Leicester's coaching staff since 2004, taking over as head coach in 2009 and becoming director of rugby in 2010. But following a 16-12 defeat by Saracens on New Year's Day, and with Leicester 15 points adrift of leaders Wasps, Cockerill was sacked. Jones said: \"I have a massive amount of sympathy for Richard Cockerill. \"He is a great rugby guy, a great player for Leicester, has been a very successful director of rugby and coach. \"You don't like to see that happen to anyone but the reality of being a coach is that everyone goes through that and I am sure he will end up somewhere else. \"It has been a discussion point for the Leicester players. They are disappointed for Richard but know they have to get on with the job. \"We are very well endowed with the forwards coaches we have at the moment so we can always look at the possibility of that [getting Cockerill].\" Former England lock Steve Borthwick is currently England's forwards coach. Hartley's dismissal in Northampton's 37-10 home defeat by Leinster had jeopardised his involvement in England's Six Nations campaign, with their opening fixture against France at Twickenham on 4 February. However, he is eligible to play again from 23 January. Jones added: \"A prerequisite to get into the England side is to be very fit and not playing games means he needs to undergo an unbelievably stringent fitness programme over the next five or six weeks. He is doing that and is in the best position to continue as captain. \"If Dylan is right to play, he will be captain. \"Everyone makes mistakes. In the last 12 months, he has made one mistake and done a hell of a lot of good things so his batting average is pretty high. If that falls, then we need to look at things. \"We have had a number of chats, not any longer than five minutes, but plenty of information has been exchanged. He understands where he is at and what he needs to do. He will do it.\" The former Australia coach said it was a \"big relief\" to have James Haskell back in contention after the flanker missed the autumn internationals with a toe injury.

But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an \"appalling smell\". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: \"You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. \"If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. \"The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat.\" Members of the church had spent \u00c2\u00a310,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: \"We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do. \"Money has been spent, not only by the congregation, not only out of church funds, but local people have mucked in and helped. \"And yet we're no further forward, we're still as we were 10 years ago.\" Lucy Bellini, of Natural England, said the bats had to be carefully monitored. Ms Bellini said: \"It is a really regionally important roost. \"Because of that we need to be sure that there are replacement roosts that are suitable and that the bats have found and are aware of and can move to before we allow the church to seal up access points and move the bats out of the church.\""

The latest figures suggest more than one in five people in Wales are living in poverty. The Welsh government said getting people out of poverty was at the \"very heart\" of what it does. Earlier this year, the Communities Committee published a report that stated it was \"deeply concerned by the Welsh government's lack of progress in reducing poverty\". Poverty is statistically defined as a household income below \u00c2\u00a3271 a week - 60% of the national mid-point average of \u00c2\u00a3453. Figures from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggest 23% of people in Wales are living in poverty - a figure which the committee said has barely changed since the early 2000s. Labour AM Christine Chapman said the Welsh government was \"going in the right direction\" but the pace of change \"needs to be quicker\". \"We are a rich country in the main but yet people are still struggling with their heating bills, with their food - that is absolutely appalling,\" she said. \"There must be a strong message first of all to the UK government that things need to change.\" Gemma Jones, a caseworker for Rhondda Cynon Taff Citizens Advice, said despite government initiatives, she sees little evidence of improvement. \"I don't know what's going wrong or what's happening but we're certainly seeing a lot more clients in poverty and not saying I'm better off,\" she said. A Welsh government spokesman responded: \"All government departments are working relentlessly to tackle the root causes of poverty, by giving children the best possible start in life, helping people to get a job and improving their health and wellbeing. \"We also continue to do all we can to mitigate the effects of the UK government's sweeping welfare reforms and austerity measures.

      "text": "For many Americans, The Daily Show has become an alternative way of learning about the world. And Stewart - jabbing his pen, wrong-footing interviewees, delivering impassioned monologues, and yes, cracking a gag or two - has been its biggest draw. Here are some of his highlights. At the turn of the century when Jon Stewart, newly-installed host, dubbed his show's US presidential election coverage \"Indecision 2000\" few knew how apt the name would become. George W Bush's campaign against then-Vice President Al Gore would last far beyond election day as workers in Florida struggled through recounts and the Supreme Court eventually got involved. Surrounded by talent like Lewis Black, Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert, Stewart lampooned politicians as well as reporters for taking themselves too seriously. \"After 19 days, and endless court battles, the Florida vote has been certified, giving the state - and presidency - to George W Bush, by a total of 537 votes,\" he said in one skit. \"Wow. That's a landslide. If you are running for student council treasurer.\" In his first broadcast after the 9/11 attacks, Stewart delivered a tearful, highly personal attempt to make sense of the worst terror attacks in US history. He opened with an apology for \"another entertainment show beginning with an overwrought speech of a shaken host and television is nothing if not redundant\". \"They said to get back to work. And there were no jobs available for a man in the foetal position under his desk crying,\" he said, drawing one of the few laughs. He concluded by saying: \"The view from my apartment was the World Trade Centre. Now it's gone.\" \"But you know what the view is now? The Statue of Liberty. The view from the south of Manhattan is the Statue of Liberty. You can't beat that.\" In 2006, Stewart was given a gift in the form of a bizarre incident where then US Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot and injured a companion, Harry Whittington, while on a quail hunt. Stewart noted that Whittington was the first person to be shot by a US vice president since Alexander Hamilton was shot by Aaron Burr in 1804. \"Hamilton [was] of course shot in a duel with Aaron Burr over issues of honour, integrity and political manoeuvring. Whittington? Mistaken for a bird.\" The financial crisis was at its peak in 2009. Markets slumped, with commentators comparing the crash to the Great Depression of the 1930s. For several episodes, Stewart criticised business network CNBC for failing to predict the collapse of major US financial institutions or question their soundness, culminating in an angry exchange with one of the network's bullish hosts, Jim Cramer. \"You knew what the banks were doing, and yet you were touting it for months and months. The entire network was,\" Stewart said. \"And so now to pretend that this was some sort of crazy, once-in-a-lifetime tsunami that no-one could have seen coming, is disingenuous at best and criminal at worst.\" Barack Obama has made several appearances on the show, for the first time as a youthful,"

The RFL has said the new Bradford side will take the place of the old one in the second tier but start the season with a 12-point deduction. They have set a deadline of Monday, 9 January for bids to be submitted. A decision is then expected within two weeks and, should an agreement be reached, the new Bradford side would play their first competitive game against Hull KR on Sunday, 5 February. Jamie Peacock, who captained Bradford to their last Super League title in 2005 before joining Leeds, believes a reformed Bradford club can be successful if they can get through what is likely to be a tough spell in the short term. \"They had the same situation in 1963, reformed in 1964 and were winning trophies again within about five years,\" former England captain Peacock told BBC Radio 5 live. \"That may be more difficult this time, but I think they've got more chance of being successful now it's not saddled with the debts it's had. \"This year will be a difficult year for the club and whoever starts the club up again, given the handicap of losing 12 points. \"But if they can spend within their means this year and go hard again in 2018, there's no reason why can't become successful again.\""

      "text": "This is basic economics. As the rig count of American production picks up, according to the most recent data published this week, there's an expectation that production will rise, supply increase, and the price subsides. There are shorter term fluctuations. Wednesday's trading has been affected by Saudi Arabia confirming it is cutting supply to Asian customers, in line with its commitment last month to the wider cut in production by the OPEC exporters cartel. But the trend of recent weeks has anticipated the growth in output. And we learned from energy analysts Wood Mackenzie on Wednesday that it foresees the Texas fields of the Permian Basin to the main player as the frackers return to work. Further south, there are shale developments moving ahead in Argentina. WoodMac, based in Edinburgh, forecasts investment is going to pick up more widely this year, for the first time since 2014. Oil companies, which have been holding back from committing to big projects while the price has been low, are showing signs of changing that. This is not only because of a much higher price than this time last year, but also because costs have been slashed over the past couple of years - by an average 20% for each of the past two years. That process is running out of the opportunities to keep cutting, but exploration and production spend is set to rise to $450bn, the forecast suggests. That's a 3% rise, but it's still 40% below 2014. Areas to watch include 'tight oil', including fracking - up by a forecast 23% in the US, to $61 billion, and potentially boosted by the Trump administration's enthusiasm for energy security and scepticism about climate change. Final investment decisions on major projects reached 40 in 2014, and fell to nine last year. The forecast is for 20 this year, most of these smaller projects building incrementally on existing infrastructure, with much higher return on investment than in the boom times of only three years ago. Deepwater drilling may get more attention, but half of the existing big deepwater projects are reckoned to break even at more than $60, so they are looking doubtful for the foreseeable. Among the regions worth watching, the North Sea does not feature, but Norway's northern Barents Sea is worth watching, including an area in which there's a dispute with Russia. That's while the ethical watchdogs who police Norway's vast state oil fund have served warning that they're going after industries which are the worst polluters. The fund owns around 2% of the world's stock market valuation, and it is widely seen as providing a lead on ethical investments. So a fund sourced from oil and gas revenues and profits is now turning against those who burn the stuff irresponsibly."

But he responded brilliantly. To vote for the BBC African Footballer of the Year follow this link His positive attitude, consistently good performances and goals played a part in helping the Swans stave off relegation from the Premier League. Ayew scored two crucial goals in a 3-1 win over Liverpool to help earn a result which finally confirmed Swansea's safety after a nerve-racking 2015-2016 campaign. In total Ayew notched 12 goals in 35 appearances and his impact was recognised when he was named the newcomer of the year at the club's end-of-season awards. His form was so impressive that, in August, the Hammers broke their transfer record to bring Ayew to east London at a cost of \u00a320.5m. Ayew was then seriously injured on his league debut, but after a two-month absence he returned to action at the end of October. And it is \"the hunger in Ayew's eyes\", as seen by former Ghana international Yaw Preko when they first played together, that could drive Ayew on to show his worth this coming season. In international football, Ayew continued to be Ghana's main man in 2016. He was on the scoresheet and put in a man-of-the-match performance in the 2-0 win over Mauritius which booked the Black Stars a place at next year's Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon. Ayew has been used to dealing with the pressure and expectation that comes with being the son of Ghana legend Abedi Pele Ayew, who is widely rated as one of the finest African players of all time. Ayew senior played 73 times and scored 33 goals for the Black Stars and helped them win the 1982 Nations Cup and finish runners-up in 1992. He also won the 1993 European Champions League with Marseille, having lost in the final of the European Cup two years earlier. Ahmed Brynes, a coach at Ghanaian side Nania FC where Ayew first began to follow in his father's footsteps, has made a fascinating prediction. \"When Ayew was only about 14, he was already performing magic and he was even saying 'I want to be better than my father',\" Byrnes told BBC Sport. \"I told him, 'look, your father has just raised the bar too high for you'... but he replied 'I will overcome it' and I believe with time he's going to overcome it.\" Abedi Pele Ayew was named BBC African Footballer of the Year in 1992. Ayew junior emulated that feat in 2011 - could this be the year he surpasses it?"

The test flight was the first launch from New Zealand and is a major first step in an emerging market: launching cheap disposable rockets to carry small satellites and other payloads. The company plans to start frequent commercial launches later this year. Poor weather conditions had pushed the launch into the fourth day of a 10-day window and the Electron finally cleared its pad at 16:20 local time (04:20 GMT). The launch was conducted with no media or spectators permitted, but the company released a video of the lift-off on its Twitter page. \"It was a great flight,\" chief executive Peter Beck said in a statement after the launch, adding though that the rocket did not quite reach orbit, the path on which its future cargo would embark on its revolution of the Earth. \"We'll be investigating why, however reaching space in our first test puts us in an incredibly strong position to accelerate the commercial phase of our programme, deliver our customers to orbit and make space open for business.\" The test launch, one of three planned, did not carry a payload as such, although it was packed with sensor equipment to help engineers understand how the flight performed. Eventually, Rocket Lab says it will be lofting payloads up to 150kg (331lbs) into a 500km-high orbits that go from pole to pole. We're on the cusp of something quite exciting.

At the moment, the economics and flight schedules of these small satellites are still being defined by the availability and price of a ride on a big rocket. Rocket Lab aims to change that. And there others, such as Richard Branson's LauncherOne project. Rocket Lab's second vehicle is already built and set to fly in the next couple months. Keep an eye on the end of the year too because this US/NZ outfit even has a contract to send a small lander to the Moon. Rocket Lab's founder and chief executive Peter Beck is from New Zealand and the firm has a New Zealand subsidiary. The country has less air traffic, compared to say the US, so there is less need for flights to be rerouted every time a rocket is sent to space. New Zealand is also positioned well to get satellites into a north-to-south orbit around Earth. The trajectory takes the rocket out over open water, far from from people and property. The country hopes these favourable factors will help it become a low-cost space hub. Nice touch: The Electron has nine engines on its first stage and one engine on its second stage. They are called Rutherford engines - after the great New Zealand-born physicist Ernest Rutherford"

The rouble fell to a rate of 57 to the dollar on Monday, a fall of more than 6%, after some gains last week. Russia's economy, heavily reliant on energy exports, has been hit by the oil price slump and Western sanctions. The sanctions, imposed because of Russian support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, target the oil and gas industries as well as banks, arms manufacturers and the wealthy elite close to President Vladimir Putin. Russia blocked most imported Western food in retaliation for the measures. The rouble has lost half its value against the dollar this year. The Russian ministry for economic development said the manufacturing, construction, agriculture and service sectors all contracted in November. Energy, mining and the retail trade showed continued growth. President Putin signed a law on Monday doubling the deposit guarantee for bank accounts, to 1.4m roubles (\u00c2\u00a316,290; $25,370). The last time Russia suffered a major economic crisis, in 1998, many ordinary Russians saw their bank savings wiped out. Mr Putin has also given the Russian central bank the power to recapitalise the country's biggest retail bank, Sberbank, directly with soft loans. The total must not exceed Sberbank's capital as measured on 1 January 2015. The \"subordinated debt\" issued by the central bank, if Sberbank needs it, will not have to be repaid until other loans have been paid off. It is a cushion in case Sberbank gets into financial difficulty. Other banks can be recapitalised by the central bank through Russia's deposit guarantee agency, using federal government bonds."

He added that the verdict is \"not finalised\" - referring to an expected appeal. Rezaian's lawyer, Leila Ahsan, told the Associated Press news agency she had not been informed of the verdict or the details of the sentence. The foreign editor of the Washington Post, Douglas Jehl, said in a statement that Rezaian's \"trial and sentence are a sham, and he should be released immediately\". He added that the journalist had already spent 487 days in prison. Rezaian, his wife, who is also a journalist, and two photojournalists were arrested in July 2014 in Iran. Rezaian was the only one of the group not to be released. The Post's Tehran bureau chief since 2012, he was charged with espionage and distributing propaganda against the Islamic Republic. He is a dual Iranian-American citizen and was tried in four hearings behind closed doors. He was convicted in October. Earlier reports said Rezaian could face 10 to 20 years in prison."

      "text": "Researchers, who have carried out a four-year review of the literature, say the evidence of damage is now \"conclusive\". The scientists say the threat to nature is the same as that once posed by the notorious chemical DDT. Manufacturers say the pesticides are not harming bees or other species. Neonicotinoids were introduced in the early 1990s as a replacement for older, more damaging chemicals. They are a systemic insecticide, meaning that they are absorbed into every cell in a plant, making all parts poisonous to pests. But some scientists have been concerned about their impact, almost since the moment they were introduced. Much of the worry has surrounded their effects on bees. There's been a well documented, global decline in these critical pollinators. Many researchers believe that exposure to neonicotinoids has been an important destabilising factor for the species. In 2011, environmental campaigners, the IUCN, established an international scientific taskforce on systemic pesticides to look into the impacts of these chemicals. The members have reviewed over 800 peer reviewed papers that have been published in the past 20 years. Their assessment of the global impact says the threat posed goes far beyond bees. In their report, to be published next month, they argue that neonicotinoids and another chemical called fipronil are poisoning the earth, the air and the water. The pesticides accumulate in the soil and leach into water, and pose a significant problem for earthworms, freshwater snails, butterflies and birds. The researchers say that the classic measurements used to assess the toxicity of a pesticide are not effective for these systemic varieties and conceal their true impact. They point to one of the studies in the review carried out in the Netherlands. It found that higher levels of neonicotinoids in water reduced the levels of aquatic invertebrates, which are the main prey for a whole range of species including wading birds, trout and salmon. \"There is so much evidence, going far beyond bees,\" Prof Dave Goulson from the University of Sussex told BBC News. \"They accumulate in soils, they are commonly turning up in waterways at levels that exceed the lethal dose for things that live in streams. \"It is impossible to deny that these things are having major environmental impacts.\" The scientists are very worried about the prophylactic use of neonicotinoids, where seeds are coated in the chemicals and the plant grows up with the ability to destroy pests already built in. \"It is a bit like taking antibiotics to avoid getting ill,\" said Prof Goulson, one of a team of 29 scientists involved in the research. \"The more they are used, the stronger the selective pressure you place on pest insects to become resistant to them. Using them as prophylactics is absolute madness in that sense.\" The task force argues that with neonicotinoids and fipronil making up around a third of the world market in insecticides, farmers are over-relying on them in the same way as they once became over reliant on chemicals like DDT. \"We have forgotten those lessons and we're back to where we were in the"

No single case concerned me more as foreign minister.\" Mr Gustafsson was kidnapped along with South African Stephen McGown and Dutchman Sjaak Rijke. Mr Rijke was freed by French special forces in April 2015 after he was discovered by chance in a dawn raid in northern Mali. AQIM took a number of Western hostages before the French military deployed its forces in January 2013.

Former Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews had been planning to cut the 22 councils to eight or nine. But First Minister Carwyn Jones has said the Welsh Government will have to rethink its plans to win wider support. Mr Andrews is no longer in government after losing his Rhondda seat at the election in May, and the Labour manifesto did not include a commitment on the number of councils it would like to see. As a minority government, Labour will need the support of other parties if any cut is to happen. Speaking on the Good Morning Wales programme on Monday, Mr Goodway said: \"The status quo isn't an option. \"You really cannot maintain 22 local authorities unless you're prepared to dismantle local government as we know it and create other organisations or bodies that would be responsible for some of the major services such as education, social services and possibly economic development. \"I would like to see the experts in the field, who happen to be those that run local authorities - whether they're councillors or council officials - coming forward with well-developed proposals to meet the government's aims. \"I do not want to see a top-down reorganisation imposed on Welsh local government, particularly at a time when you're seeing a lot of new faces in the assembly, people who don't have the expertise in local government to shape those services. \"I really do hope now the Welsh Local Government Association and the leaders in local government will come forward and seriously develop a set of proposals, hopefully capturing the city region dimension.\" On Sunday, the first minister told BBC Radio Wales he wanted to talk to opposition parties about the future of local government. \"Clearly, the map we published before the election, that is not going to gain support across the assembly, that's obvious,\" Mr Jones told the Sunday Supplement programme. Meanwhile trade unions representing council workers have asked for urgent talks on the issue with the new finance and local government secretary Mark Drakeford. Dominic MacAskill, head of local government in Wales for Unison, said: \"We are in a state of limbo and, in that state of limbo, the workforce is anxious and fearful of the future.\""

The HRW report focuses on the treatment of a Christian group in Vietnam. The group said the Thai response showed how freedom of speech had been eroded since the army seized power last year. Thai police said the event at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand could \"have an impact on the country's security or could affect the friendship and cooperation between Thailand and Vietnam\". It is the third human rights event at the venue that has been halted by authorities in the past month. The HRW report describes what it says is the persecution of Montagnard Christians in Vietnam's central highlands. Their religious practices have been described by the Vietnamese government as \"evil\". Sunai Phasuk, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher in Asia, said the decision to cancel the report's launch was \"very disappointing\". \"Thailand is now going to be known as the defender of human rights violators in [Southeast Asia], which adds more damage to Thailand's already tarnished international reputation under the military rule,\" he added. Thai authorities have launched a crackdown on critics since the military seized power from a civilian government in May 2014."

Malaysia's economic performance has been \"relatively sluggish\" over the last decade, a government report stated. It blames this poor performance on low labour productivity. The problem was identified more than a decade ago when the country began to face stiff competition in exports from low wage countries like China. At that time, Malaysian leaders said they had to move towards a knowledge-based economy. This led to the construction of a hi-tech city near Kuala Lumpur called Cyberjaya. Billed as the \"Silicon Valley of the East\", this was the first city to be fully connected with high-speed internet using fibre-optic cables. Officials also hoped that tax incentives and an English-speaking workforce would lure foreign companies to help turn Malaysia from a low-cost to a hi-tech producer. US computer maker Dell was one of the companies that took up the offer. Pang Yee Beng, managing director of Dell Cyberjaya, says it makes sense to be based there. \"Ultimately we are looking for a place where we can get consistent service in terms of IT infrastructure,\" he says. \"We needed a place where politically or security-wise it was stable, and then when you set up a complex facility like this you really need government support to make it happen.\" Today, Dell's operations in Cyberjaya include a customer call centre and a technical support team for its global operations. The four-storey complex sits in the same cluster as other multinational companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and AMD. But critics say Cyberjaya hasn't become the success that Malaysian leaders had in mind. An advisor to the Cyberjaya project, TJ Singh, says the government originally wanted to attract innovative global giants who could in turn mentor Malaysian companies, especially in the area of software. \"What they wanted were local companies that were world class,\" says Mr Singh. But that didn't happen. Mr Singh says more and more multinational companies took advantage of Cyberjaya's cheap land and set up back offices for their global operations. It has succeeded in creating a big service industry, says Mr Singh, but not exactly the type of innovation that government leaders wanted to take place in Cyberjaya. Analysts say many companies end up doing their research and development overseas, partly because they cannot find the right talent. In 2010, a World Bank report estimated that about one million Malaysians were living abroad. A third of them are well educated and mainly ethnic Chinese and Indians. Economists with the World Bank say ethnic minorities feel discriminated against by the government's preferential policies for the Malays. Malaysia practices affirmative action for the Malay-majority, granting them priority in university scholarships and government jobs. These are efforts to redistribute wealth to the Malays, who are historically poorer than other ethnic groups. But in a bid to help Malays catch up, Malaysian politicians have also flip flopped on the language of instruction for sciences and maths, switching from Malay to English and then back again.

He added a penalty in injury-time which was awarded after Sam Clucas was sent off for handball from Lucas Perez's header. In between, Hector Bellerin and Sanchez both failed to hit the target and Mesut Ozil volleyed over the crossbar for Arsenal. Striker Oumar Niasse had Hull's best chances - his header and low strike forced Petr Cech into sharp saves - while Adama Diomande nodded over late on. Arsenal had been pressing for the opener before Sanchez's intervention. The visitors failed to clear Kieran Gibbs' low shot and as the ball ricocheted off goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic on the ground it bounced off the Chilean's hand and into the net. For a deliberate handball, Football Association laws state: Media playback is not supported on this device On this occasion, Sanchez did not look like he purposefully pushed the ball into the net and he had little time to move out of the way after the ball came off Jakupovic. After consultation with his assistant, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded the goal, but prior to that in the first half, Theo Walcott had a shot blocked by the hand of Clucas inside the area, for which no penalty was given. After the game, Hull defender Andrew Robertson told Sky Sports that Clattenburg had apologised to the Hull players after half-time. Robertson added: \"The ref told us he didn't give it because he wasn't 100% sure. Not many referees can admit they're wrong, so it's good when he does, though it doesn't make things better.\" News app users should click this link to vote Chasing the game in the second half, Hull's Lazar Markovic was running onto a long punt forward deep in the Arsenal half. The Serb was barged down by Gibbs, who was the last defender, and had the on-loan Liverpool man not been infringed, he would have had a clear run through on goal from 30 yards. Clattenburg spotted the incident and presented a yellow card. Gibbs said after the game: \"I took a chance with the challenge on Markovic. The ref said the ball was going away from goal.\" When asked if Gibbs should have been sent off, Hull boss Marco Silva said: \"Yes. It is true. Markovic go to the goal.\" With Hull pushing for an equaliser, they were hit on the counter by the home side. Jakupovic came sprinting off his line as Sanchez went round him and picked out Perez at the back post, but the Spaniard's goal-bound header was kept out by Clucas' arm on the line. Clucas was given a red card for the incident. Sanchez stepped up to take the penalty, drilling a low finish into the net, which was his seventh goal against Hull in just four games. It was also his 17th top-flight strike this season, making him the league's leading marksman.

For many, the EU remains a \"one-way\" street, as another man put it. For instance, older people used to the modernity EU membership brought back in 1981 cannot envisage ever leaving. But for some younger Greeks in Thessaloniki, capital of a region with 30% unemployment, exit is an attractive idea, or at least the abandonment of the hated euro. \"You cannot put a lion and a cat in the same cage,\" one unemployed young man told me on the street, describing how he sees relations between Greece and the economic giants of the north. Change may take a generation if it ever happens, given the continuing support for the parties tied to the financial crisis, New Democracy and Pasok, and doubts over the willingness of the radical left in the form of Syriza to really effect change. Meanwhile there is marble-cold anger at the relentless impoverishment of a nation on the edge of Europe. Former businessman Stefanos Dimoulas now works as a pizza delivery \"boy\", in his words, for 3.3 euros (\u00c2\u00a32.7; $4.5) an hour without medical insurance. He has business debts of 50,000 euros but also, after a recent operation to remove a rare tumour in his neck, he owes 3,000 euros in medical bills. Now he needs more treatment. Mr Dimoulas did not say for whom he would vote, but expressed dismay at the way Pasok and New Democracy were ruling together after decades on opposite sides. He sees Greece's future outside the eurozone and outside the EU full stop, prospering with control over its own resources and currency. His is a positive position, imbued with love for Greece, with none of the nationalist hate associated with the far-right Golden Dawn party. I encountered some Golden Dawn supporters. Not the aggressive men I was used to seeing in TV reports, but two old-age pensioners getting drunk on spirits at a cafe table and a careworn middle-aged farmer, incensed at the low price of milk offered for his dairy herd. None of them spoke to me. It was their friends nearby who informed me of their stance. Making it my mission to interview unemployed or economically vulnerable Greeks primarily, quite at random near the cafes in Thessaloniki where they sit outside on walls or lawns because they cannot afford a simple cup of coffee anymore, I invariably met people preparing to vote for parties of the left. Again, they gave no names of parties, but there was a distaste for the traditional left and a readiness to experiment, it seemed to me, with newer parties. These include Antarsya, an anti-EU, anti-capitalist coalition created five years ago which won less than 1% of the vote at the last national election in 2012. One of its European election candidates, Foteini Rizou, I met out of the blue at a backpacker hostel, where she works as a receptionist"

The changes were proposed by four DUP MLAs, but Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard said their motion was based on \"seriously misguided logic\". He added that enforcing the 30-minute free parking system would be \"extremely resource intensive\". However, the assembly did pass a Sinn F\u00e9in amendment calling for a review of on-street parking arrangements which Mr Hazzard said he was \"minded\" to implement. \"I'm certainly not opposed to a review of sorts - a strategic review of on-street car parking policy and the direction of travel,\" the minister told BBC News NI. \"What I was opposed to, with the DUP motion, was their pre-determined outcome of any such review, that we would set in stone before we began a massive reduction in penalty fines, I don't think that would be appropriate.\" The rejected DUP motion was signed by ex-minister Edwin Poots, and his party colleagues William Humphrey, George Robinson and Alex Easton. They said \"greater flexibility\" was needed in parking policy to encourage more trade in town and villages. Parking enforcement in Northern Ireland was privatised in 2006. Initially, fines were levied at \u00a360, with the option of a 50% reduction if the bill was paid within a fortnight. However, in 2012, Stormont MLAs voted for the penalty to be increased to its current level of \u00a390 - or \u00a345 if it is settled within 14 days. The then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy said at the time that bigger fines would \"act as a greater deterrent to those who choose not to park properly\". The current minister said \"at least two thirds\" of people who receive parking tickets pay within two weeks, and therefore pay at the lower rate of \u00a345. \"I think, when we look across many states, this is an appropriate amount, \"Mr Hazzard added. Last month, a Belfast City Council committee voted to end the council's annual policy of offering free car parking in the city centre in the run-up to Christmas."

The unions have rejected a pay offer of 1% which they say represents a 13% pay cut in real terms since 2008. The employers maintain the offer is a good outcome for staff. The unions say they are willing to meet for last minute talks but say they are not optimistic \"as the employers had so far refused to engage in talks aimed at resolving the dispute\". Michael MacNeil, head of higher education at UCU, said: \"There is widespread anger over the pay cuts staff have had to endure in recent years and all the reports we are getting suggest that Thursday's strike will be very well supported. \"We are amazed the employers are still refusing to sit down with us to try and resolve this without any need for disruption. There are precious few hours left now, but our offer of talks remains open.\" Unison's head of higher education Jon Richards accused university management of \"sitting on record surpluses, splashing out on senior management pay but refusing to give a decent wage to the staff who have made UK universities some of the best in the world\". The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents the universities as employers, has expressed disappointment at the rejection of the offer. A spokesman for UCEA said that less than 5% of the higher education workforce had chosen to vote in favour of strike action and predicted \"a low level impact on students\". The spokesman said that they had made their final pay offer in May and had been engaged in a dispute resolution process with the unions throughout the summer. \"We have met repeatedly over the last six months and as recently as last week.\" The spokesman added that \"salary costs in most HE institutions will actually rise by around 3% this year. \"Many staff will also get generous incremental increases and contribution pay. These pay increases will be seen as generous by many looking into the sector.\" He added that the GMB union had agreed to accept the pay offer for its members employed by universities. For Unite, the turnout for the ballot was 28% and of these, 64% (1,654 members) voted in favour of action. For the UCU the turnout was 35%, with 62% voting in favour of strike action. Unison said that of those who had voted, 54.4% had been in favour of action and 45.6% against. UCU says its members last went on strike over pay in 2006."

Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put \"in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara\". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

The trust said the lochside wood was a \"Nessie spawning ground\". Previous explanations for the monster have included circus elephants being exercised in the waters. Several reported sightings of Nessie have been made recently. Another image of an object in the loch was thought to be the wake of a boat. Monster enthusiasts had earlier in the year been lamenting a lack of incidents. Gary Campbell, who keeps a register of sightings, said in February that for the first time in almost 90 years no \"confirmed sightings\" had been made of the monster. He said at the time no-one had come forward in 18 months to say they had seen the monster. Being mistaken for tree has been no barrier to fame for other \"monsters\". Groot, above, is one of Marvel Comics' forest of unusual characters. A Flora colossus from Planet X, the capital of the branch worlds, Groot is one of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy portrayed in a series of comic book stories. The character was among the most popular of a movie based on the stories released over the summer, and a clip of the creature dancing has been viewed almost three million times on YouTube. Like Nessie, Groot has proved to be a goldmine in terms of merchandising with various toys created in his image. Ents, giant woodland shepherds, appear in JRR Tolkien stories. Film director Peter Jackson portrayed Ents as more tree-like than they appear in the books in his adaption of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. The Woodland Trust said Nessie spotters might be disappointed to learn debris from Urquhart Bay Wood, near Drumnadrochit and the famous Urquhart Castle, was a likely cause of at least one of the recent sightings. A spokesman said: \"Large amounts of wood flows out of the woodland through the two winding rivers that flow into Loch Ness each year, peaking when water is high in late autumn and spring. \"I think that some of that debris explains long thin - some stick-like - shapes seen.\" The spokesman added: \"Urquhart Bay is a really important wet woodland, made up of species such as ash, alder, rowan and willow. \"It's one of very few intact floodplain woodlands remaining in the UK and has European importance. Challenges such as flooding, movement of the rivers and accumulation of woody debris make it an interesting place to manage.\" Known locally as The Cover, the wood was once part of the Glen Urquhart Estate. Originally the woodland was granted to the Earls of Seaforth by King James IV in 1509. The wood is situated on a flat low-lying area of alluvial sand and gravel deposits between the deltas of the Rivers Coiltie and Enrick where they flow into Loch Ness. Alder and ash are the main tree species but there are also bird cherry and hazel and small numbers of wych elm, gean, holly, rowan and elder. The Woodland Trust manages 56"

Kidman said while she doesn't have to work, she does so because of her passion for cinema. The star of The Killing of the Sacred Deer, in competition at Cannes, said her young children will be banned from seeing the dark psychological thriller. Kidman has two grown-up children from her marriage to Tom Cruise and two younger daughters with her current husband singer Keith Urban. \"My (younger) children have very little understanding of what me or my husband do. Their lives are obviously far more important!\" She added: \"I'm at that stage in my life where I still try to act as if I'm 21 and starting my career. \"At this stage of my life, I'm just trying to stay very bold and open and try things and support film-makers I believe in.\" The Killing of the Sacred Deer features an eminent surgeon Steven Murphy - played by Colin Farrell - who adopts a teenager into his family. Things start to go horribly wrong when the boy turns against Murphy. Kidman plays ophthalmologist Anna Murphy, who is married to Steven. It's directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek filmmaker behind indie hit The Lobster, which won the Jury Prize at Cannes two years ago. Farrell also starred in that film. Kidman said she was \"hypnotised\" by Lanthimos' script. She has four projects showing at the festival this year, but said: \"That's a confluence of events - that's not something I was aware would be happening.\" Her other Cannes showings are in The Beguiled and How to Talk to Girls at Parties, as well as the second series of TV drama Top of the Lake, from Jane Campion.

Mr Pinera supports Chile's abortion laws, which outlaw the practice in all circumstances. His critics want it legalised in cases of rape, and want the girl to be allowed an abortion. The 11-year-old girl appeared in a TV interview on Monday, saying: \"I'm going to love the baby very much, even though it comes from that man who hurt me. \"It will be like having a doll in my arms.\" The girl was raped repeatedly over a two-year period by her mother's boyfriend, who has since been arrested. Mr Pinera said he had asked the health minister to personally look after the girl's health. \"She surprised us all with words showing depth and maturity when she said that, despite the pain caused by the man who raped her, she wanted to have and take care of her baby,\" he said. Forensic psychologist Giorgio Agostini said the girl would not have the mental or emotional capacity to understand her situation. Sources: World Health Organization, Guttmacher Institute \"What the president is saying doesn't get close to the psychological truth of an 11-year-old-girl,\" he told the Associated Press news agency. \"It's a subjective view that is not based on any scientific reasoning.\" The girl's case has already sparked a public debate about abortion. Campaigners argue that the laws, which date back to the authoritarian rule of Gen Augusto Pinochet, should be changed to allow for abortions in cases of rape or when the mother's health is at risk. Michelle Bachelet, the likely presidential candidate next year for the left-leaning opposition, supports the campaign. Ms Bachelet earlier commented that the 11-year-old girl need to be protected. \"I think a therapeutic abortion, in this case because of rape, would be in order,\" she said. Chile is one of seven Latin American countries where abortion is completely banned. Last month, the case of a seriously ill woman in El Salvador made international headlines when the courts upheld the ban on abortion even though the woman's life was at risk and the foetus was unlikely to survive. She was eventually allowed to have a caesarean section."

Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as \"requiring improvement\", while Lakeside was rated \"good\" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was \"inadequate\", while \"weak teaching\" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often \"disengaged and disruptive\". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a \"culture of low expectations\", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were \"beginning to have an impact\". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having \"over generous\" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were \"not making the progress they should\" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers. Inspectors, did however highlight new initiatives to improve literacy which they said were \"beginning to have a positive impact\"."

The filing states Yelchin left behind at least $641,000 (\u00a3486,000) in personal property and had $731,000 (\u00a3554,000) in equity in his home. Yelchin was best known for playing Pavel Chekov in the new Star Trek films. TMZ reports that Yelchin's parents plan to file a wrongful death lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler, which made the Jeep that killed their son. They are expected to announce their intentions to file the suit at a press conference on Tuesday. In April, the company recalled 1.1m vehicles worldwide over the risk they could roll away after drivers exit. The vehicle that killed Yelchin, who was 27 years old, was one of those subject to a recall because the gear shifters confused drivers, causing the vehicles to roll away unexpectedly. Fiat Chrysler offered their sympathies to Yelchin's family in a statement, but said it could not comment on their plans for a lawsuit. The company added it was speeding up its recall of the vehicle.

Sheffield City Council was ordered to pay former worker Richard Rowe, who was abused by Dodds in the 1980s, the sum. He is also expected to receive a similar amount for loss of earnings. Read more about this and other stories from across Yorkshire Sex abuser 'left free to assault' Dodds worked at the council's education department from 1975 to 1993. The council allowed Dodds to retire with full pension in 1993, despite widespread knowledge among staff of his conduct. The authority has said it was \"deeply sorry\" and accepted responsibility. It said it had \"made a raft of changes in policies, practices and procedures\", and added that it commissioned an internal report into Dodds' behaviour in 2008. The report found the authority was \"complicit\" and allowed Dodds to operate \"apparently without sufficient challenge, accountability or consequences\". The council said things have changed significantly and many recommendations have already been implemented. Since Dodds' conviction, others have come forward alleging abuse. Mr Rowe was the victim of \"surprise attacks\" by Dodds in the late 1970s and while he conceded there was \"some comfort\" in the 16-year jail term, he said it \"could have been stopped a lot sooner\". He added: \"All the staff knew, it was common gossip, but the seniors... chose to ignore it.\" Mr Rowe said he was suspended by the council for a time in 2008 when police started investigating Dodds. BBC Social Affairs Correspondent, Michael Buchanan, reported that Dodds is still getting a council pension in prison. South Yorkshire Pensions Authority, which is responsible for the funds, said the council had not tried to halt the payments. The Authority said a conviction does not automatically stop a pension and it is the responsibility of the council to initiate proceedings."

Asia-Pacific leaders meeting at an economic summit in Peru over the weekend pledged to pursue free trade deals despite Mr Trump's opposition. But when the US withdraws, what will the fate of the TPP be? Here is some reaction. Time will tell whether and to what extent the new administration and the new congress engages with the TPP or an evolved version of that agreement. There is very strong support among the other 11 parties to the TPP to ratify it and to seek to bring it into force. So Mr Trump and his new congress will have to make their own decisions in America's interest. It is very clear that from Australia's point of view, getting greater access for Australian exports, whether it is goods or services to those big markets is manifestly in our interest. The United States is not an island. It can't just sit there and say it's not going to trade with the rest of the World, and at some point it will have to give some consideration to that. It is President-elect Donald Trump's right as the democratically-elected next leader of the United States to make the policy decisions he thinks right. I am a strong supporter of developing trade and open regionalism in Asia Pacific. It is key to benefiting our peoples. I look forward to working with President-elect Trump on our shared goals of strengthening security and ensuring growth that is inclusive, sustainable and fair to all. This is very depressing news. It means the end of US leadership on trade and the passing of the baton to Asia. At a time of slowing economic growth, the world can ill-afford watching the largest economies turn inward. This is not surprising given all that Trump said during the campaign, but it is still disappointing. US withdrawal from the TPP kills a deal that was a decade in the works. The irony is that, though Trump has called it a horrible deal, it was actually very good for the US. It would have given the US a very strong say over the rules of trade between Asia and America, putting more of a focus on labour rights and intellectual-property rights. The collapse of the TPP will now create a void in Asia. There is lots of talk about China now moving in to fill it, becoming the region's leader in shaping trade agreements. But that will be hard for it to do because many other governments are wary of its export machine. For better or worse, this gives Asia and the Pacific to China and its friends. There are several billion people with strong economies, little debt, and huge assets in the area. It will be a major turning point in history whichever way the world now turns out.

Bristol Crown Court was told the truck was too big to legally travel down Lansdown Lane in Bath. Driver Phillip Potter, 20, of Dauntsey, denies causing the deaths by dangerous and careless driving. His boss Matthew Gordon, 30, of Dauntsey, who was driving another truck in front of Mr Potter, also denies 14 offences while the truck company's mechanic Peter Wood, 55, of Brinkworth, denies four charges. Prosecutor, Adam Vaitilingam QC told the court Lansdown Lane, which has a 6ft (1.8m) width restriction for HGVs, was known locally as a \"rat run\". He said: \"These two lorries were both a lot wider that 6ft - they were about 8.5ft (2.6m) wide - and they were not using Lansdown Lane for access - they were using it as a short cut. \"They were ignoring the prohibitions. These lorries were not allowed to be and should never have been on Lansdown Lane.\" The jury heard tachograph records show the drivers had not taken mandatory breaks in the hours before the collision and both lorries were speeding as they approached Lansdown Lane. Mr Vaitilingam said the ABS warning light, which indicates problems with the braking system, was on in Mr Potter's lorry meaning it should not have been driven. Mr Potter and Mr Gordon were driving two trucks carrying 32-tonne loads from a Wiltshire quarry on 9 February last year when the crash happened. The court previously heard the brakes of Mr Potter's truck failed and the vehicle hit several pedestrians including Mitzi and a car containing Mr Allen and Mr Vaughan, both from Swansea, and Mr Parker, from Cwmbran, south Wales. Mr Potter is also charged with causing serious injuries to Karla Brennan and Margaret Rogers - Mitzi's grandmother - by dangerous driving. He denies a total of 10 charges against him. The trial continues."

It is a second leg which now appears a formality amid a hectic schedule that could see Real play 21 times in 11 weeks.

Rodriguez had previously said he would consider his future in January after playing a minor role so far this season, but made the most of a rare start by scoring a spectacular long-range opener and adding his second from the penalty spot after Luca Modric was fouled by Mariano.

HRW urges external pressure on The Gambia to prevent further violence. In a report published on Wednesday, the group says two Gambian activists have died in custody, with dozens of critics of President Jammeh in jail. They are being denied medical or legal help, the report says. The Gambia, a popular tourist destination because of its beaches, has never experienced a democratic transition of power since independence. Mr Jammeh took over in a 1994 coup. His critics accuse him of running a repressive state, an allegation he denies. Most of the major Gambian opposition parties last week picked a single candidate - businessman Adama Barrow of the United Democratic Party (UDP). Mr Barrow's nomination is the result of the biggest opposition alliance in Gambia since independence, the AFP news agency reported. HRW says the prospect of political change in December has prompted Mr Jammeh's government to step up oppression against critics. It claims a torture squad, linked to the presidential guard, is terrorising opponents ahead of the election. The group wants freedom benchmarks to be imposed now - by the United States, the European Union and The Gambia's West African neighbours - to prevent more bloodshed. Last week, The Gambia said it would pull of the International Criminal Court (ICC) after accusing the tribunal of persecuting and humiliating Africans. The small West African nation joined South Africa and Burundi in saying it will withdraw from the court."

Temporary Det Ch Insp Martin Tate added: \"Leonne's family have had their entire lives turned upside down over the last couple of days and are utterly devastated.\" Police have been granted an extension to the murder suspect's custody as they continue with inquiries.

He will set out to convince Congress of his proposal in his first address to a joint session on Tuesday night. But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said his plan is \"dead on arrival\". \"It's not going to happen. It would be a disaster. If you take soft power off the table then you're never going to win the war,\" Senator Graham said. Soft power is an American term that refers to diplomatic tools such as foreign aid and humanitarian relief. \"What's most disturbing about the cut to the State Department's budget is it shows a lack of understanding of what it takes to win the war,\" Senator Graham continued. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also said Mr Trump's reported deep cuts to the State Department would \"probably not\" pass Congress. The Republican-controlled Congress must approve any federal spending. To the White House, foreign aid might seem like an easy target for cuts, but those who protect the country think otherwise. In their letter to lawmakers more than 120 former military officers quoted the Defence Secretary James Mattis from his days as a field commander: \"If you don't fully fund the State Department then I need to buy more ammunition.\" They argued that strengthening diplomacy and development were critical to preventing conflict. International assistance in the State Department budget does more than respond to humanitarian needs, it also supports policy goals. For example, it supplements the military fight against the so-called Islamic State through programmes to disrupt the group's financing and recruitment, and to stabilise communities where IS has been driven out. There's money to address the underlying causes of migration from Central America, and to strengthen allies such as Afghanistan and Ukraine. The former Secretary of State John Kerry was known to make a strong case for increasing the department's financing, (which at $50bn makes up just 1% of the entire budget). The new Secretary Rex Tillerson will have to fight simply to keep what he has, or the State Department will be marginalised in an administration focused on the military. The president released a budget proposal on Monday calling for a $54bn (\u00c2\u00a343bn) boost to military spending. This would be paid for, according to the plan, by gutting other programmes including foreign aid and the environmental agency. The White House also plans to reduce spending for the State Department and USAID, say US media reports, which together received an estimated $50.1bn during the current fiscal year, or a little more than 1% of the total federal budget. More than 120 retired generals have signed a letter urging Congress not to cut funding for diplomacy and foreign aid. The letter said: \"As you and your colleagues address the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018, we write as retired three and four star flag and general officers from all branches of the armed services to share our strong conviction that elevating and strengthening diplomacy and development alongside defense are critical to"

The Scottish government formally backed the Heathrow bid earlier this month. It came after the airport made a list of commitments to Scotland, including creating up to 16,000 jobs and investing \u00c2\u00a3200m in the country. Heathrow also said it would help to develop new domestic routes to Scottish airports, and would investigate whether Prestwick Airport - which is owned by the Scottish government - could be used as a \"logistics hub\" for the new runway. Responding to Mr Grayling's announcement, Scotland's economy secretary Keith Brown said he looked forward to the UK government \"cracking on with this as soon as possible\", while stressing that environmental and planning restraints needed to be taken into account. Mr Brown said: \"We announced our support for the third runway at Heathrow two weeks ago, so we are pleased that the UK government has the same view.\" He predicted there would be \"a number of benefits for people in Scotland\" as a result of the decision, including \"around \u00c2\u00a3200m of spend for companies in Scotland, and the establishment of a hub airport in Scotland to support for Heathrow as its undergoing its change in infrastructure\". And he added: \"Potentially we've seen the airports commission saying there could be around 16,000 jobs for Scotland, and obviously we want to see that followed through. \"Beyond that, increased connectedness between Scotland and the rest of the world will benefit our economy and our tourist industry.\" AGS Airports, which owns Glasgow and Aberdeen airports, also welcomed the announcement, which it said would play an important role in supporting the Scottish economy. But the operators of Edinburgh Airport said ahead of the decision that they believed Gatwick \"offered the better deal for Scotland\" and described the Heathrow plan as \"undeliverable\" and potentially \"bad for passengers\". And both the Scottish Greens and Scottish Liberal Democrats have criticised the announcement. The plan to build a new runway at Heathrow - which is expected to cost more than \u00c2\u00a317bn - now faces a long consultation before it becomes reality, with MPs not voting on the proposals until 2017 or 2018, and the new runway not being opened until 2025 at the earliest. Several Conservative MPs oppose the proposals, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Education Secretary Justine Greening and former London Mayor candidate Zac Goldsmith, who has resigned as an MP in protest. The opposition largely centres concerns about the noise and environmental impact of Heathrow expansion, with the decision expected to lead to further protests and legal challenges. Some 783 homes will have to be demolished for the third runway, according to the Airports Commission, including the entire community of Longford and much of Harmondsworth. The new runway will also mean several other residential areas will fall under the Heathrow flight path for the first time. But most airlines and business groups are in favour of expanding Heathrow - Britain's busiest airport - as it offers more direct connections than Gatwick"

      "text": "Though the unverified story was short on details, and did not have the husband's side of the story, \"divorced because of fat face\" quickly became a top trend on microblogging network Weibo. State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be \"large and square\" with \"fat cheeks\". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; \u00c2\u00a3183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as \"when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break\". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, \u00c2\u00a32,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: \"It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so.\" It continued: \"This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself.\" Said another Weibo user: \"Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you.\" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: \"1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.\" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. \"What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?\" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics."

Ex-captain Chris Robshaw is back on the blind-side after missing the Wales win. Coach Eddie Jones has opted to start with the same pack which began the final Six Nations game against France. England secured the Grand Slam with a 31-21 victory in Paris, but they have never won a Test series in Australia, winning just three of 17 Tests down under. \"It's important we get off to a positive start and we'll arrive ready to play physical and aggressive rugby,\" said Jones. \"We have a young squad with an average age of 24, so we are still developing and improving. It'll be a great challenge for us.\" Captain Dylan Hartley was more bullish, however. \"If we don't expect to win, I don't see the point in even boarding the plane,\" the 30-year-old told BBC Sport. \"We expect to win, we believe we can win, we are here to win.\" England fly-half Ford, 23, missed six out of seven kicks at goal during the 27-13 warm-up victory over Wales. That performance, combined with Farrell's brilliant form for title-winning Saracens, seems to have influenced the coach's decision. There had been suggestions Maro Itoje might move from lock to blind-side flanker in place of Robshaw, who missed the Wales game to attend his brother's wedding, with Joe Launchbury coming into the second row. Media playback is not supported on this device However, Wasps lock Launchbury - man of the match against Wales - has to settle for a place on the bench alongside Northampton second row Courtney Lawes. Alex Goode, the newly-crowned Aviva Premiership player of the season, has been left out of the 23, while full-back Mike Brown is poised to win his 50th cap. Australia have named three debutants - centre Samu Kerevi, lock Rory Arnold and winger Dane Haylett-Petty - as they bulk up their side. BBC Radio 5 live rugby reporter Chris Jones: Jones has long-spoken about the first Test as a physical battle - and the selection of Burrell in the midfield certainly supports that view. With Jones keen for a ball carrier at number 12, Ford was always likely to be the one to make way, especially with Farrell in the form of his career. Nowell's relegation to the bench is a shock, though. Jones says the Exeter man is \"not quite sharp\" while Yarde is \"in a purple patch\". With two locks on the bench - Launchbury and Lawes - Itoje is likely to move to the flank in the second half. It may be a three-Test series, but the message from the England camp here in Brisbane is that Saturday's game is a \"must-win\". England: 15. Mike Brown; 14. Anthony Watson, 13. Jonathan Joseph, 12. Luther Burrell, 11. Marland Yarde; 10. Owen Farrell, 9. Ben Youngs; 1. Mako Vunipola, 2. Dylan Hartley, 3. Dan Cole, 4. Maro Itoje, 5. George Kruis, 6. Chris Robshaw, 7. James Haskell, 8.

In December Niazi, 30, was found guilty of bludgeoning Ms Cruz to death with a hammer in 2011 and jailed for 12 years. The council said it was now conducting a \"domestic homicide review\". An Ofsted report said the council had not adequately addressed \"all the areas identified\" in its internal management review, which has never been published but has been seen by BBC London. Duncan Clark, Kingston's director of children and learning, resigned with a \u00c2\u00a3128,000 pay-off the day before the Ofsted report was published. The internal review found on one occasion a social services manager did not think the referral was serious enough to warrant a home visit. On the second occasion in September 2011 the manager did not read the referrals but took the documents home to read. That night, Niazi killed 37-year-old Ms Cruz by hitting her 50 times with a hammer. The council, Mr Clark and two social work managers criticised in the internal review have refused to comment. Kingston Council would only say it was conducting a \"domestic homicide review\" into the case, that new senior managers had been appointed and a \"significant investment\" had been made. A council spokesman said: \"A number of significant actions have been taken in response to the findings of the Ofsted inspection and the improvement notice in order to improve safeguarding arrangements for children. \"The council is implementing the improvement plan and there is good progress on delivering this agenda.\" Kingston's former acting head of social care, Olivia Butler, who ordered the internal investigation into what went wrong, said what she uncovered was \"very poor practice and tantamount to negligence\". According to the internal documents, Ms Cruz first emailed children's charity the NSPCC at the beginning of September 2011 as her relationship was breaking down due to Niazi's abuse. The charity asked Kingston Council to visit her at her home but a social work manager decided emailed advice was sufficient, the report stated. The situation worsened and Ms Cruz contacted the Child Safeguarding department on 23 September saying she was \"shocked and scared\" that her partner was showing their two-year-old daughter pornographic videos and encouraging her to play with cigarettes. A social worker phoned Ms Cruz the same day at which point Ms Cruz revealed Niazi, originally from Pakistan, had attempted suicide with an overdose of painkillers. The department's duty manager on 23 September, failed to ensure the conversation was logged on Kingston Council's computer system. Niazi emailed the NSPCC several times over two days asking for help controlling his emotions after smashing Ms Cruz's phone with the hammer he later murdered her with. On 25 September the police sent the Child Safeguarding department a referral informing them that Ms Cruz had visited them over the weekend, saying she was feeling unsafe and that they had visited Niazi warning him over his behaviour. The NSPCC also contacted Child Safeguarding the next morning with details of their contact with Niazi and asked the"

On his blog, comedian and campaigner Brand called the UKIP leader an \"an end of the pier, end of the road, end of days politician\". Mr Farage wrote on the Independent website that Brand had been exposed as a \"messiah with feet of clay\". The two men were joined on Thursday night's show by Conservative Communities Minister Penny Mordaunt, shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh, and Times columnist Camilla Cavendish. In an often heated debate, with members of the audience yelling at each other and the panel, Brand called Mr Farage a \"pound shop Enoch Powell\" during a section on immigration, with the UKIP leader responding by saying he believed the UK was \"overcrowded\". The barbs did not stop when filming ended, as Mr Farage said the performance of the \"sometime comedian turned banker-basher\" had been \"limp\". He wrote: \"Mr Brand will swan around and tout long-discredited, even conspiratorial, theories about the City of London, and 'who owns politicians' - but actually he had very little to give.\" For his part, Brand said Mr Farage was \"worse than stagnant, he is a tribute act, he is a nostalgic spasm for a Britain that never was; an infinite cricket green with no-one from the colonies to raise the game, grammar schools on every corner and shamed women breastfeeding under giant parasols\". The breastfeeding reference followed a row over Mr Farage's suggestion that some venues might ask mothers to \"perhaps sit in a corner\" to feed their babies. Both men praised the audience of Question Time, which was filmed in Canterbury. Brand, who was urged to stand for Parliament by one man in the crowd. added: \"The only worthwhile sentiments, be they raging or insightful, come from the audience\". Other questions focused on the NHS, grammar schools and trust in politicians. The programme was watched by an average of 3.5 million viewers, with the audience peaking at 4.6 million at the start. This was nearly a million higher than the previous week's episode, but well below the 7.9 million viewers who watched ex-BNP leader Nick Griffin's appearance on the show in 2009. The encounter also triggered plenty of debate on social media, with 106,000 tweets during the show - compared with 22,000 the week before."

The president has cut short his visit to Ethiopia following Abas Abdullahi Sheikh's killing, state radio reports. He grew up in a refugee camp, and became Somalia's youngest MP in November and a minister in February. Somalia has been wracked by conflict since the long-serving ruler Siad Barre was ousted in 1991. It is currently battling militant Islamists from the al-Shabab group, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda. Security forces on patrol came across a vehicle blocking the road and, thinking it was being driven by militants, opened fire, police Major Nur Hussein told Reuters news agency. Mr Abas was killed \"by mistake - they opened fire on his car accidentally. May God rest his soul\", Mogadishu mayoral spokesman Abdifatah Omar Halane was quoted as saying. A rising star has been killed: Abdirizak Atosh, BBC Somali, Nairobi Somali youth have been robbed of a role model following the shocking death of Mr Abas. Always polite and well-dressed, the former child refugee was widely admired for his determination to succeed. Coming from a prominent religious family, Mr Abas studied at Kenya's prestigious Nairobi University and entered politics last year. He became an MP for the port city of Kismayo in Somalia's Jubbaland region after an electoral college chose him ahead of a government minister who had been on the political scene for more than two decades. Mr Abas' victory showed that Somalis were fed up with the old guard, and were demanding change. Sensing his popularity with the youth, the president appointed him to the cabinet in March. Less than three months later, this rising star has become the latest casualty of more than two decades of violence in Somalia. But in this case some are asking: Has Somalia lost a future president? Mr Abas was given a state funeral in Mogadishu attended by President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed Farmajo, members of parliament, Somali youth and elders. President Farmajo has ordered security chiefs to \"immediately get to the bottom of this unfortunate tragedy\" and make sure the perpetrators were \"brought to book\". Information Minister Abdirahman Osman said several people had been arrested, but did not give details, state-owned Radio Mogadishu reported. Troops are sometimes nervous, and have previously shot officials - and each other - by mistake, says BBC Somalia analyst Abdullahi Abdi. But Mr Abas, the public works minister, is probably the most high-ranking official killed by \"friendly fire\", he adds. Mr Abas grew up in Dadaab camp in Kenya, home to hundreds of thousands of Somalis who fled drought and conflict. The president appointed Mr Abas to the cabinet following his surprise election victory in February. President Farmajo promised to improve security and establish an effective government in Somalia. Much of the country is still under the control of al-Shabab."

Originally a term for the city's poor who scraped a meagre living by scavenging in the river's mud, it has been adopted by a new breed of treasure hunters, often armed with metal detectors. These men and women show off their favourite finds, and discuss the joys of mudlarking. Dave Hiddleston, Limehouse Long fascinated by history and collecting, Dave first discovered mudlarking while he was working on Cannon Street and saw people on the foreshore in wellington boots. His favourite find is an English community cloth seal, which he believes was used to stamp cloth bags coming through London in about 1618. It was inside a lump of burnt cinder. Dave said: \"I am always encouraging others to go mudlarking. It is a great escape from the humdrum of modern life, and interesting doing research on your finds. \"Plus you get to meet some really interesting like-minded people.\" Edward Sandling, Vauxhall Ted discovered mudlarking by chance. \"I was walking along South Bank,\" he said, \"and I just hopped over a gate and came down to the foreshore. You get a sense of quietude and the perspectives on the city are so different, just by that small change of level.\" He then noticed the objects at his feet, such as this pipe stem shaped like a horse's hoof. He said: \"I have finds that are older and perhaps more beautiful, but this is the one that set it all off. \"It's absolutely beautiful. To hold it and know that someone else was smoking it 150 to 200 years ago is amazing.\" Ted believes that London's beauty lies in the fact that it hasn't all been embanked, and its tides allow these things to be found on the beaches: \"It churns up discoveries every day. Every tide there are new things to be found.\" The one item he is holding out for is a Bartmann jug, decorated stoneware from Germany that was used to transport food, drink and goods. For Ted, \"they inspire thoughts of darkly forested mountains\". Andrea Smith, Rotherhithe Although she began only in October last year, Andrea makes time to go to the shore up to six times a week.

This shard represents this to me.\" Sara Cannizzaro, Vauxhall It's the unexpectedness of mudlarking that drew Sara to it, in contrast to the routine of London life. \"I feel the excitement when I'm walking along the bank,\" she said. \"It's a way of making order out of chaos.\" Sara has managed to find a piece of Bartmann jug, which - from the splashes of cobalt blue glaze - she has dated to 1600-20, made in Frechen.

      "text": "His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued. When Lennon left Celtic two years ago, it was to pursue a"

      "text": "The 2009 world champion, 34, has been vying with Kevin Magnussen, 22, for the right to partner Fernando Alonso. The team plan to make their decision public at a news conference at their Surrey factory on Thursday morning. Spaniard Alonso, a double world champion, has returned to McLaren after five seasons with Ferrari. McLaren chairman Ron Dennis said at the final race of 2014 that a choice between Button and Magnussen would be made on a \"clinical and emotionless analysis of the options\". Button, who made his F1 debut in 2000, said at an awards ceremony on Sunday: \"It's a strange situation but sometimes in life you find yourself in these situations. You just have to deal with it.\" If the Englishman, who finished eighth this season, misses out on a McLaren drive for 2015, his F1 career could be over. Rival teams have already confirmed their driver line-ups for next year. Alonso's future was decided some weeks ago but Dennis has vacillated over who to choose as his team-mate. He had to weigh up the pros and cons of Button's experience and greater performance in 2014 - he scored more than twice as many points as Magnussen - against the Dane's youth and potential. Financial considerations may also be part of the decision. Button was earning a salary of \u00a312m in 2014, while Magnussen, in his debut season, was on about \u00a3500,000. The Dane finished 11th in the standings, having taken second place in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. If Button is axed by McLaren, he has an option to move to the FIA World Endurance Championship, a path followed by his friend Mark Webber when he retired from F1 at the end of 2013. Button, who began his F1 career at Williams, also has a passion for triathlons and could turn his focus in that direction. McLaren's capture of Alonso was sealed weeks before the end of the 2014 season, but the team were waiting to make a decision on their second driver before announcing the complete line-up. Alonso left Ferrari after their worst season for 21 years convinced him they were not capable of winning the world championship in the foreseeable future. The Spaniard believes he has a better chance of success - and a third world title - with McLaren. The team have had a difficult two seasons but their new engine partnership with Honda and a team restructure, which included the signing of key personnel, helped persuade Alonso to join. Alonso endured a difficult single season with McLaren in 2007, leaving just one year into a three-year contract. But his need for a more competitive car and McLaren's desire to sign an A-list driver convinced the two parties to work together again. Alonso is reputed to have signed a deal worth $40m (\u00a325.5m) a year, which would make him the best-paid driver on the grid. The contract is believed to be for two years with an option for one more, but Alonso will almost certainly be able to leave at the end of 2015 if"

Among them is a dietician, physiologist, doctor, running partner, coaches, and logistical support. The former world triathlon champion said: \"I cannot stress how important my support team are. You are the person who has to go out and deliver the performance, but there is a whole team behind you that make it happen, from coaching and cooking to being there and being great friends. \"The hard work of a lot of people is transferred into my performance on the day.\" Stanford, who was born in Bridgend, lived in Swansea and went to university in Birmingham. She was World Triathlon champion in 2013, is now based in Leeds as part of British Triathlon squad, including the Brownlee brothers. She said: \"I am very fortunate that all the people I work with are not just staff, they are very good friends and the atmosphere is great.\" But who are the 20 people working behind the scenes to get Stanford to the start line? The logistics - getting her there on the day Behind the scenes Stanford needs to be entered into races, have accommodation and transport booked, and have everything put in place to ensure she is safe at competitions. Performance director of British Triathlon Brendan Purcell looks after everything related to competitions. \"A lot of things go on behind the scenes that we don't know about which he takes care of,\" said Stanford. \"He was involved in organising, planning and putting in place important aspects of our build up and time in Rio; he has to do a lot of the things we don't even know about.\" The logistics of getting Stanford and her kit there on the day falls to Laura Macey. \"We call Laura the 'Loracle' because she absolutely does everything for us,\" said Stanford. \"From booking all our flights and accommodation, to organising our camps, getting our kit to where it needs to be, to knowing about our races. \"She is the busiest lady I know.\" Running, swimming and cycling - working on technique Stanford's team of coaches work on different areas of the triathlon. Giving Stanford tips on the running track is Malcolm Brown, who has been involved with the Brownlee brothers from an early age. \"Malcolm is the calming voice in the setup,\" said Stanford. \"He knows what to say, and if he says something that is what goes. He is great to have around. His expertise in running is evident. Jack Maitland focuses on the swimming programme, while head coach Ben Bright takes more of an overview. \"Ben oversees all my training,\" said Stanford. \"He makes sure it is all fitting together. His opinion is very important to me. He is someone I feel very fortunate to have on my coaching team. He has helped me to come that"

A Twitter campaign - #Get1DToLeah - called for the pop band to contact her. Friends said Ms Washington would be \"elated\" at the news. Sara Stuart, who helped start the campaign, said she had been to the Royal Stoke Hospital to visit the teenager, whom she described as a huge fan of the band. \"She's seen them so many times,\" Ms Stuart said. \"It's really given Leah something to aim for and really look forward to once she's recovered.\" The campaign has received thousands of retweets. \"The support has been overwhelming. It made me so happy that so many people were supporting one of my closest friends.\" She said the message \"would make Leah's day and aid her recovery\". She added her friend had tickets to see the band in concert in Cardiff on Saturday but was unable to go because of her injuries. The band are currently in Europe as part of a world tour. \"After visiting her yesterday and knowing how upset she was that she missed seeing them on Saturday, we decided we would try and get in touch with them to see if they were prepared to visit her or send her a video message,\" she said. \"She would love this.\" The band's agents said the band's four members - Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson - had filmed a video message for Ms Washington. \"Unfortunately because of their schedule they can't visit her in hospital, but they have offered Leah tickets to a forthcoming concert of her choice when she has recovered, and will be delighted to meet her backstage then,\" they said. Band member Louis Tomlinson has already sent her his best wishes. He said he was thinking about her and hoping she was back home soon. Ms Washington's boyfriend, 18-year-old Joe Pugh, from Barnsley, is being treated for two broken knees and \"extensive\" hand injuries at the Royal Stoke University Hospital. The couple were in the front row of the Smiler ride, alongside Daniel Thorpe and Vicky Balch, when it hit an empty carriage last week. Chanda Chauhan, 49, from Wednesbury, who was sitting in the second row of the ride, was taken to hospital with internal injuries. The crash left 16 people trapped 25ft (7.6m) above the ground for about four-and-a-half hours."

He admitted defrauding the First Trust Bank, two counts of theft and transferring over \u00a3110,000 of property out of his employer's business account. In August 2012, Annett went into Lurgan police station to admit responsibility. A prosecution lawyer told the court that in 2007, while working for Portadown-based JP Hagan Solicitors he was \"approached by a senior partner who asked him if he wanted to become a partner in the firm.\" \"The offer came at a cost - the cost was \u00a3250,000. The defendant remortgaged his home at Church Road with First Trust Bank/Allied Irish Bank.\" Personal account He already had a mortgage with UCB Home Loans, which totalled \u00a3220,000. The lawyer said that the First Trust Bank believed \"they would be the first charge on the property\". The money was released to Hagan's Solicitors to settle the UCB mortgage and pay the \u00a3250,000 to take up the partnership. However, the lawyer said, the UCB mortgage \"was not discharged\" and \"the defendant accessed the business account and transferred the entire amount of monies into his personal account\". In another incident, Annett was approached by a County Down family who had been offered \u00a325,000 to buy its land. Investment property He said he would have the money checked out under the proceeds of crime legislation. Whilst having the money in his possession Annett removed \u00a317,380 out of the \u00a325,000. The court also heard that, in March 2008, Annett moved \u00a3112,000 out of the law firm's business account to \"buy himself an investment property in Corby, England\". A defence lawyer said that, after going to the police station. Annett went to see his minister and the elders of his church and confessed his crimes."

She was eventually caught at a shopping centre in Cwmbran, south Wales. Her haul, Newport Crown Court heard, included bags made by Mulberry, Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Dior and Burberry valued at up to \u00a3200 each. Rand sold some of the bags on online auction site eBay. She is known to have made \u00a388,000 in sales from the stolen bags but their retail value would have been closer to double that figure. On Friday, Judge Rhys Rowlands told her she had \"made a business of stealing\" and her actions had been \"planned, calculated and persistent\". \"I have not seen such a case before. You travelled significant distances to steal from up and down the country and target high value bags,\" the judge added. The court heard how Rand, a housewife and mother of two, was able to carry out her crimes and even stole to order for some of her online buyers. Prosecutor David Wooler said: \"She stole handbags from all over the country. \"She targeted department stores including Debenhams, House of Fraser and John Lewis. \"Her usual method of theft was to go into the store without a bag, pick up one from the display, walk around with it on her shoulder for a while, then simply walk out of the store. \"Sometimes she would have to remove the security tag, but usually she wouldn't have to.\" But her crime spree came to an end when security staff at a shopping centre in Cwmbran caught her and alerted police. The court heard after officers began to investigate they found she had listed a significant number of handbags for sale on eBay priced competitively. \"Her house was full of sealable grey delivery bags and Post Office receipts,\" the prosecutor told the court. \"She set up a legitimate business and no one, not even her husband, knew what she was doing. \"Rand told police she needed money to fund her lifestyle.\" She admitted stealing 905 handbags and four purses from House of Fraser and various retail businesses between December 2009 and December 2012. She also admitted converting criminal assets from 838 handbags. The court was told the cost price of the handbags was in excess of \u00a3130,000 but the prosecutor said the retail price would be much greater. In her defence, Andrew Taylor, said: \"She bitterly regrets everything that she's done.\" \"She became almost immune to the feeling of wrongdoing. \"She was almost addicted to stealing high-value bags in an attempt to keep the ship afloat. \"She never expected to find herself in such dire circumstances and out of desperation took this course of action.\" During sentencing, Judge Rhys Rowlands told Rand: \"This was a remarkably serious raft of thefts which only ended when you were caught stealing a valuable handbag from a store in Cwmbran. \"How you got away with it for so long without being caught was deeply remarkable. \"You showed professionalism and that is why you went undetected"

The awards will be held at the Roundhouse in London on 20 November. TrueTube's success \"demonstrates the shift in how young audiences are consuming media\", Bafta said. The website's drama nomination is for Refugee, a 12-minute film following a British girl and her family who have fled their home, while Katie, about a gay, Catholic nurse in a children's ward, is up for the learning award. TrueTube senior education producer Bob Ayres said: \"We are over the moon. We are a small charity-funded online channel and to be nominated alongside such giants feels like an attack of vertigo. \"We are very, very proud the films we make for young people and schools have been given such recognition, and extremely pleased they will now reach a wider audience.\" The Shakespeare special from the gruesomely entertaining Horrible Histories is up for the comedy and writing trophies and actor Tom Stourton will compete for the best performer honour for playing the role of the Bard. Elsewhere, a number of programmes received two nominations. Cartoon Network's The Amazing World of Gumball is up for the animation and writer awards. CBBC's Hetty Feather and The Dog Ate my Homework are among the other double nominees. The annual Bafta Children's Awards also recognise movies which have been on general release in UK cinemas. This year, the academy has chosen Zootropolis, The Good Dinosaur, The Jungle Book and Star Wars: The Force Awakens for its feature film award. Star Wars is also in the running for two other awards - best game for Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens and the adapted interactive prize for Star Wars Arcade.

He was due to get his boots on for the Gloucestershire non-leaguers last month, but the match was called off. A club spokesman said with Pearce on side, it was hoping to get its \"very first win of the season\" on Saturday. Rooted to the bottom of the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League Division Two, Longford AFC has lost all its games this season and conceded nearly 200 goals - earning it the name of \"the worst team in England\". But following their star January signing, club treasurer Mike Dean said the squad had been training hard and \"games haven't been as bad\". \"We went down to Bisham Abbey - the old England stomping ground - a couple of weeks ago with Stuart and were training down there for about two-and-a-half hours,\" he said. \"We have been getting beat but the scores are only 1-0, 2-0 - very low now. So things are getting better and the confidence is in the side.\" On Saturday, 53-year-old Pearce - nicknamed Psycho - will be turning out for Langford AFC in a bottom of the league clash with Wotton Rovers. Simon Graham, Wotton Rovers manager, said it was \"chuffed\" but their right winger was a \"little bit nervous\" about marking an \"ex-England superstar\". \"We've got a young squad and Stuart Pearce's legs aren't as fresh as they used to be so we'll run some rings around him,\" he said. Pearce, who won 78 England caps, was part of Sir Bobby Robson's squad that reached the last four of the World Cup in Italy in 1990, and the Terry Venables-led side that was eliminated at the same stage of Euro '96. He retired from playing six years after that, having enjoyed spells at Newcastle United, Manchester City, West Ham, Coventry and non-league Wealdstone, as well as captaining Forest under the management of Brian Clough."

But ministers say it is a \"balance of risk\" and will stop children smoking. Tattoo parlours will also need licences under the Public Health Bill. In taking the decision to bring in the e-cigarette ban, ministers have argued they did not want to take the risk of seeing smoking \"normalised\" again after the success of the smoking ban. The new tobacco and e-cigarette measures will mean: This final measure is proving the most controversial and is likely to come into force in 2017, but a precise date has not been given. Public Health Wales, local health boards and the BMA are in favour of the e-cigarettes curbs. But anti-smoking campaign group ASH Wales, Cancer Research UK and Tenovus are among those opposed and the British Heart Foundation, British Lung Foundation and Royal College of Physicians want more evidence. In a public consultation on the proposals last year, 79% of responses were opposed. 19% of adults in Wales smoke 16% target by 2020 70% of smokers want to quit 44% tried to quit in past year 2.6m British adults use e-cigarettes 61% of vapers want to quit smoking There have been concerns that it might make it more difficult for smokers using e-cigarettes as a way of stopping. George Butterworth, tobacco policy manager for Cancer Research UK, said there was no evidence of normalisation of e-cigarettes with young people - and those using them were \"very, very small numbers\". \"Those that are, are the type of people who would try alcohol or tobacco cigarettes anyway - so without that evidence we wouldn't support a ban on the use of e-cigarettes indoors under the idea of normalisation,\" he said. \"E-cigarettes are an opportunity for people to move away from tobacco smoking which is very, very bad for their health, and we wouldn't want to put up any barriers to prevent people from quitting cigarettes. \" By Nick Triggle, health correspondent E-cigarettes have really divided health opinion - and that in turn has caused confusion. However, the arguments for and against them are in fact typical of many that have been heard down the years in the field of health. That is to say it is all about balancing risk and benefit - and as evidence is still emerging it is only natural to find a variety of opinion. On their own, there is little to recommend the use of e-cigarettes. They contain some toxins and, therefore, in theory are potentially harmful - both to those using them and, possibly, through passive smoking. But this debate is further complicated by the fact that it is not just the merits of e-cigarettes that are being discussed, but their impact on smoking tobacco products. Some, for example, have argued they act as a gateway to real smoking. But, of course, e-cigarettes cannot be seen in isolation. Smoking them - and this is about the only thing that is not"

Political leaders, businesses, sporting organisations, and charities will meet at Lancaster House on Thursday. Mr Cameron says corruption is \"the root of so many of the world's problems\". He also described it as \"an enemy of progress\". \"It destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,\" he added. \"The battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart. \"For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs.\" Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg. Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde. Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it. Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions. A Downing Street spokesman said: \"We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit.\" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: \"The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come. \"What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions\"."

Although regulations and an asbestos problem might make buying the school difficult, he said the company will work with the school board to come up with a solution that works, and intends to help cover some costs. \"Somebody's got to step to the plate and somebody's got to help fix the situation,\" he said. Mr Chapman proposed buying the building and leasing it back to the school board at a reasonable rate in order to keep the school open. But the aging building could require millions of dollars worth of repairs, and regulations make it tricky for a private company to buy a public building still intended for public use. \"Essentially what we were proposing was a giant band aid to delay the situation,\" he said. The school is one of about 600 - many in rural areas - that the province has earmarked to be shut down in order to save costs. If Beavercrest were to close, children from the town would have to spend up to 90 minutes in a bus commuting to one of three other schools in the area. It has 195 students but has a capacity for 319, according to a recent report by the local school board. \"We all realise that something needs to happen and something needs to change, but whatever happens needs to benefit the students,\" he said. An alumnus of Beavercrest himself, Mr Chapman said helping isn't just the right thing to do, it's smart business. Chapman's, which was founded in 1973 by his parents, is one of the largest ice cream manufacturers in Canada and has doubled its workforce over the past six years, he said. The company intends to expand even more, and that means they need to attract people to the small town of Markdale, which has a population of just 1,325. Mr Chapman said he's already struggled to attract people to the area, even after raising wages. \"Where are these people going to come from, especially if we don't have an elementary school in this area?\" he said."

Moreno was displaced at left-back by James Milner last season but Reds manager Jurgen Klopp is in no hurry to sell the player, although Moreno may also want more first-team football at this stage of his career. The Anfield club are confident they will get their full asking price for Sakho, 27, given the current market for centre-backs and the player's successful loan spell at Premier League rivals Palace last season. Serbia winger Markovic is another player unlikely to be in Klopp's plans, especially following the addition of \u00a334m forward Mohamed Salah from Roma. New Watford manager Marco Silva may make a move for the 23-year-old, who joined Liverpool from Benfica in a \u00a320m deal three years ago, after being impressed with Markovic during a loan spell at Hull City last season.

She warned that the vacancies could not be filled entirely by British workers. Ms Cameron also called for a migration system that responded to Scotland's lower population growth rate. She said Scotland's projected population growth to 2024 was only 3.1%, compared with a projected 7.5% increase for England over the same period. She warned that could leave the economy growing more slowly and unable to sustain public service levels. Ms Cameron's comments came as the prime minister prepares to get Brexit negotiations under way. Theresa May has set a deadline of 31 March for invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, getting official talks with the EU started. In a statement, Ms Cameron said: \"It is time to make the case for a new migration system that works for the UK, works for Scotland and, above all, works for business. \"Free movement of people across Europe may have led us to become complacent about the effort that is required to target the talents that our businesses need across all sectors and all parts of the UK. \"We need to plan now for a system that will be focused on sourcing the right talent, wherever in the world that exists, and in the numbers that meet the demands of our economy.\" Giving greater control over immigration to Holyrood has been a key demand of Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in the wake of the Brexit vote. However in January the home secretary appeared to rule out the possibility of Scotland being handed powers over immigration after the UK leaves the EU. Amber Rudd said introducing different rules \"would complicate the immigration system, harming its integrity\" and cause problems for businesses."

They're two very important lads in our squad,\" he added. \"It's great to see they are back in training and fit and ready to go.\" Burnley travel to the Liberty Stadium on Saturday hoping to seal a win that could send them into the top half of the Premier League table. The Clarets lost against Swansea City at home on the opening day and Vokes is aware of the threat they pose given their recent return to form. \"We know that if we don't get the right result down there then it closes the gap for us [on the relegation zone],\" Vokes said. \"It's important that we get the right results in the next few games to keep that distance between us and the bottom three.\""

However no officers were assigned. An inquest jury at Southwark Crown Court said local police failed to liaise and share information. Returning a narrative verdict, a jury spokesman said the force had failed to recognise \"that you don't need a named perpetrator and named victim for there to be a threat to life\". Mr Morgan, who was a member of the Lambeth GAS gang, was killed in a car crash. His mother had asked police to attend the funeral because it was in a patch controlled by two rival gangs, the Peckham Young Guns and the Peckham Boys. His friend Mr Khan was in Forest Hill Road outside Camberwell Old Cemetery when he was caught in an exchange of gunfire. The killers have not been found. The jury spokesman said: \"If all relevant information regarding the funeral and gang activities were linked, the Metropolitan Police Service would have put in place a different policing plan, raising the level to either a higher risk or critical. \"If there was a visible police presence at or in the vicinity of the burial service, it may have deterred gang members.\" He said communication errors were \"prevalent\" and officers failed to liaise with each other to carry out their policing plan. Coroner Andrew Harris said he could find no systemic failings in the Met's intelligence gathering systems, but he did question its policy on threat to life. He said: \"I'm not clear that we can be confident that the Met Police has addressed this policy, and that is a considerable concern. \"Given the level of violence in this borough, I can't be satisfied that this has been dealt with.\" A Met spokeswoman said it acknowledged the jury's findings. \"Similar issues were highlighted by an independent investigation conducted by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and their recommendations were acknowledged and implemented in 2012. \"Since Mr Khan's murder there has been considerable change in the way the Met deals with intelligence. \"We will now take time to consider in detail the findings of the inquest.\""

With 93% of the votes counted, governing coalition candidate Daniel Scioli had a 14-point lead over his conservative rival, Mauricio Macri. The first round of the presidential election will be held on 25 October. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who has been in power since December 2007, will not be able to stand again as the constitution limits presidents to two terms in office. She was preceded in office by her late husband, Nestor Kirchner. Their combined 12 years in office have been dubbed \"the Kirchner era\" and opposition candidates have been campaigning on a promise of change. Mr Scioli, who is currently governor of Buenos Aires province, is the only candidate for the governing Front for Victory coalition. His main rival is Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri of the conservative Cambiemos (Let's Change) coalition. With 93% of the votes counted, Mr Macri had won 24.4% compared to Mr Scioli's 38.3%. Third was Sergio Massa, a congressman who broke away from the Front for Victory coalition to form his United for a New Alternative party. Voting in the primaries is compulsory and is not restricted to party members but open to all those eligible to cast their ballot in the presidential polls. Whoever wins is therefore seen as a favourite for the presidential polls on 25 October. The primaries were introduced in 2009 to cut down on the number of candidates running in the presidential elections with contenders having to win a minimum of 1.5% to be eligible to stand in the first round on 25 October. If no candidate wins 45% of the vote or 40% with a 10-point margin over the second-placed person, a second round will be held on 24 November. Whoever wins will need to tackle a high inflation rate, which independent analysts estimate at 30%. Mr Macri is campaigning on a promise to quickly free the markets from restraints introduced by President Fernandez while Mr Scioli advocates gradual change."

Working-age household incomes have been stagnant since 2007-08 compared with a 10% rise for pensioners. Yet, 14% of pensioners households are still on low incomes. The DWP figures also show that in 2015-16, rises in pensioner incomes stalled. A number of reports and previous data have shown that income growth has been faster among pensioners than working-age people since the financial crisis. This has led to widespread debate over the future of the triple-lock - a promise made to pensioners that the state pension will rise in line with prices, wages or 2.5%, whichever is highest. This latest set of figures shows that recently retired pensioners in the UK have seen their incomes rise compared with a decade ago. Average incomes among this group have risen from \u00a3314 in 2005-06 to \u00a3357 in the last financial year. The DWP figures show a regional split, with older people in the South East of England having much higher incomes than those living in Wales and the West Midlands. Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and now director of policy at Royal London, said: \"While there are clearly some pensioners who enjoy good company pensions and have benefited from house price inflation, there are clearly also many who are not in such a fortunate position. \"Any change to policy on state pensions need to take full account of the diversity of experience of pensioners in Britain today, and not simply assume that pensioner living standards will keep on rising.\" For all UK households, the median average income rose by \u00a38 in a year to \u00a3481 a week before housing costs in 2015-16. This stood at \u00a3413 a week after taking housing costs into account, the DWP figures show. Agnes Norris Keiller, a research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said: \"Growth in household incomes in 2015-16 was modest but widespread, continuing the pattern seen in recent years. \"The period since the recession has been defined not by sharp rises in inequality or poverty, but historically slow growth in average incomes - in 2015-16 average income for working-age adults was no higher than eight years previously.\" Official figures published on Wednesday showed that wage growth had slowed to 2.3% (excluding bonuses) in the three months to the end of January, from 2.6% in the previous three-month period."

The Home Affairs Committee said insufficient numbers of officers were initially deployed and police training for public disorder was inadequate. The Metropolitan Police said it had outlined what it was doing to improve. The Policing Large Scale Disorder: Lessons from the disturbances of August 2011 report said flooding the streets with police was what ultimately quelled the disorder. \"If numbers could have been increased more rapidly, it is possible that some of the disturbances could have been avoided,\" it said. \"We regret this did not happen and, with the benefit of hindsight, we regard the operation to police the disorder in many towns and cities, and particularly in London as flawed.\" It said the mutual aid system, under which police officers are transferred to forces in need, could have operated more quickly; it may have left areas which had loaned officers to other forces \"vulnerable\". The report said anecdotal evidence from some of those convicted suggested the widespread disorder started when people saw police had \"lost control\" in Tottenham via television and social media. This echoes the findings of the independent Riots Communities and Victims Panel. \"Clearly a feeling existed that desirable consumer goods could be made available by looting. There was a substantial element of opportunistic criminality and copycat behaviour,\" the report said. \"The absence of a police presence or sight of police officers apparently standing by and allowing criminal behaviour to take place was distressing for those whose homes and businesses were being attacked,\" it added. Committee chairman Keith Vaz MP said: \"Individual police officers acted with great bravery, and we commend them for their actions. However, in London and other areas, in contrast with the effectiveness of police responses in some towns and cities, there was a failure of police tactics. \"This situation might have been avoided had police appreciated the magnitude of the task. \"We urgently require a rapid improvement in police training to deal with public disorder. We urge the police to act more quickly in future and to review the arrangements for loaning officers from one force to another in this type of scenario.\" He said that, for those who lost their homes and businesses, \"the state effectively ceased to exist - sometimes for hours at a time\". Mr Vaz told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the committee felt that there should have been better communication between the police and the local business community to ensure that people knew what was happening and how best to protect their livelihoods. \"Those areas where the chief constables had decided to take pre-emptive action and get police officers on the streets quickly were able to contain this violence much more effectively,\" he added. The MPs say had more officers been deployed different tactics could have been used. The Met Police is training more police to use baton rounds and is considering buying three water cannon.

Championship side Burnley hit back as Sam Vokes headed in Tendayi Darikwa's cross and an Alex Iwobi interception denied Andre Gray after the break. Sanchez - making his first start since November - finished coolly to win it. The Chile international - who has made just one substitute appearance since suffering a hamstring injury in November - was lively throughout and turned in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross after Darikwa was dispossessed in midfield. There can be no doubt the holders deserved a place in Sunday's draw as they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and chances, though Burnley created a nervy finish. The impressive Gray caught sight of goal late on but could not get meaningful power in his shot and as the visitors threw bodies forward, substitute Theo Walcott missed a glorious chance to add a third on the break as he failed to round Tom Heaton. Arsenal's match programme featured the FA Cup trophy on the front cover along with the words \"To have and to hold\". They move a step closer to emulating the Blackburn Rovers side of 1886 by winning a third FA Cup in a row, though this was far from vintage. They made nine changes to the side beaten by Chelsea last weekend but still fired 23 shots at the Burnley goal as Arsene Wenger maintained his record of only losing to lower-league opposition once in 41 FA Cup ties. Solid appearances from the likes of Chambers and Iwobi show he has a squad capable of maintaining a challenge in this competition but the anxious moments - particularly with the ball in the air in their box - will continue prompt some concern. Mohamed Elneny saw more of the ball than any other player - with 100 touches - on his first outing since joining for \u00a35m from Basel earlier this month. His completion of 96% of his passes was impressive but as a deep midfielder, he often found himself with plenty of time on the ball, meaning there will be tougher tests to come. \"I felt he started a bit cautious, played a bit secure,\" said Wenger of Elneny. \"He became more adventurous. It will take him some time to adjust to the power side of our game here, but the intelligence, the mobility and the technical level are good.\" While Elneny was steady between the penalty areas, Sanchez was pivotal inside the box. He did not break stride to slam home his goal, created the opener for Chambers and looked lively throughout. His return could be crucial ahead of a key February when Arsenal play the likes of leaders Leicester, Barcelona and Manchester United. Like Arsenal, Burnley sit third in their respective table and their offering at the Emirates shows they have the grit needed to win promotion back to the top tier at the first time of asking. Gray missed an early one-on-one chance and looked"

The Kinks-inspired musical Sunny Afternoon and drama A View From the Bridge both won multiple awards. Hosted by Lenny Henry, the Oliviers ceremony took place at London's Royal Opera House on Sunday night. Accepting her statuette, Dame Angela said: \"All these years of waiting. I am so infinitely grateful to have this baby in my hands.\" The Murder, She Wrote star, who was born in east London in 1925, recalled how she started her stage career in \"a lovely play\" with Dame Peggy Ashcroft, the title of which she couldn't recall. \"I can't remember a lot of things these days - except I can remember my lines,\" she joked. She added: \"Here I am creeping up to 90 and feeling like a million dollars because I'm in London in this magnificent hall with all you - my roots, where I began.\" The actress's star turn in Blithe Spirit took place at the Gielgud Theatre where her mother, actress Moyna Macgill, made her debut on the same stage in 1918 - when the theatre was known as The Globe. The best actor prize went to Mark Strong, for his brooding performance in Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge, which enjoyed a sell-out run at Wyndham's Theatre and might soon transfer to Broadway. The role of tragic hero Eddie Carbone had lured Strong back to the stage after 12 years in film. \"What's been amazing about doing this play is the young people who that came to see it who all wanted to talk about what they were seeing,\" he said. \"Thousands of years have gone by and we still have this thing called live theatre - and the reason is that we need to be able to compare ourselves to what we see up there and judge ourselves as human beings.\" The play, originally staged at London's Young Vic, also won best revival and best director award for Ivo Van Hove. Penelope Wilton won best actress for Taken at Midnight in which she played the mother of a young German lawyer imprisoned by the Nazis. Accepting her award, she said it was a story \"that needed to be told again\". \"It has a resonance today even though it was about a man who died in 1937 - it's about the importance of democracy and freedom of speech.\" Joe Penhall's play Sunny Afternoon, which transferred to the West End from London's Hampstead Theatre, was crowned best new musical. Stars John Dagleish and George Maguire - who play The Kinks brothers Ray and Dave Davies - were awarded best actor and best supporting actor in the musical category. Ray Davies received a special outstanding achievement award for the Sunny Afternoon score. Picking up his award, Davies described The Kinks as \"four of the unlikeliest pop stars you've ever seen\". He said: \"When you write songs you write about people. Without people we have no plays we have no films. People are the source of my material."

The 14-year-old, who is profoundly deaf, says the yellow Labrador has increased her confidence and helps her sleep at night. She is one of 27 children in the UK to have been given a hearing dog by the charity Hearing Dogs for Deaf People. It was not until Poppy was nine years old that civil engineer Richard and housewife Rebecca noticed small changes in their daughter's behaviour which concerned them. \"She was turning the volume up on the TV,\" said Rebecca. \"When she was in the car she wouldn't hear me when I was talking to her, even though her brothers and sister could hear in the back.\" Concerned, they had Poppy, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, referred to an audiologist who was shocked to discover the schoolgirl was profoundly deaf and could barely hear a thing, but had been covering this up by lip-reading. Despite her acute deafness there was no affect on her schoolwork so the early signs had not been noticed. Rebecca said: \"What we realised when she was diagnosed was that she had become quite proficient in lip reading, which was how she had managed to wing her way through school. No-one had noticed as there was no change in her schoolwork.\" She was diagnosed with the rare disease Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome type 1. Although she was given hearing aids to wear in each ear, she became withdrawn and lacked confidence both socialising and doing little things like going to the shops. She had trouble getting to sleep at night as she could not wear hearing aids, which meant should could not hear anything at all and was constantly on edge about someone coming into her room. Poppy struggled by for three years feeling more and more isolated until her mother found out about hearing dogs, who help deaf people in a similar way to guide dogs. There are 850 deaf people, mostly adults, partnered with dogs in the UK. Because of her profound deafness, Poppy was the first child to be partnered with a hearing dog in Wales. The dog was named Tanni after Baroness Tanni Grey Thompson and one of just 12 given out that year. Source: Hearing Dogs for Deaf People A year on and Poppy says Tanni has changed her life. \"Having her has built my confidence,\" said Poppy. \"She gives me more independence. Before when my mum went out I would be left at home, now I can go with her and go into shops. Before I was very reluctant to go into a shop and pay by myself. I was worried as they wouldn't know I was deaf, but now they can see from Tanni that they need to speak clearly as she wears a special harness when we're out. \"Another good thing is that people ask questions about Tanni and I feel happy talking about her. It has made me more confident answering questions in general. \"I have got a best friend.\""

At least two people were killed in the attack, near the north-eastern village of El Wak on the Somali border. The Somali based al-Shabab group is the main suspect for the attack. It has not said if it was responsible, but often carries out attacks in Kenya's north-east. The bus was travelling from the capital Nairobi to the town of Mandera. When al-Shabab killed 148 people in an attack on Garissa University College in April, the militants reportedly singled out Christians and shot them, while freeing many Muslims. Last year, a bus was attacked near Mandera by al-Shabab militants, who killed 36 non-Muslims travelling to Nairobi for Christmas celebrations. \"The locals showed a sense of patriotism and belonging to each other,\" Mandera governor Ali Roba told Kenya's private Daily Nation newspaper. The militants decided to leave after the passengers' show of unity, he added. An employee of the Makkah bus company, who had spoken to the driver involved in the attack, confirmed to the BBC that Muslims had refused to be separated from their fellow Christian passengers. One of the victims was shot dead after trying to run away from the militants after passengers had been forced off the bus, the same employee told the BBC's Bashkas Jugsodaay in Nairobi. Al-Shabab has been at war with Kenya ever since Kenyan forces entered Somalia in October 2011 in an effort to crush the militants. Kenya's north-eastern region has a large population of ethnic Somalis."

The 52-year-old, a three-term tea party Republican from Wichita, Kansas, is a vehement critic of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran. He has also defended the National Security Agency's bulk data collection programme and opposes shutting the prison at Guantanamo Bay. After visiting the detention facility in 2013, he remarked that some inmates who had declared a hunger strike looked like they had put on weight. Mr Pompeo also defended the CIA after the 2014 release of the Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Torture, which detailed such interrogation practices as waterboarding. He declared: \"These men and women are not torturers, they are patriots\". The CIA tactics, he declared, \"were within the law, within the constitution\". Mr Pompeo graduated first in his class at West Point and graduated from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of its Law Review. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 with the support of the Republican mega-donors Charles and David Koch. Mr Pompeo became a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Before joining Congress, Mr Pompeo founded an aviation parts firm and an oilfield supply company. He was accused of Islamophobia for remarks he made following the deadly 2013 Boston marathon bombing. Mr Pompeo took to the House floor to suggest some Islamic faith leaders might be tacitly encouraging terrorist attacks. \"When the most devastating terrorist attacks on America in the last 20 years come overwhelmingly from people of a single faith and are performed in the name of that faith a special obligation falls on those that are the leaders of that faith,\" he said. \"Instead of responding, silence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts and, more importantly still, in those that may well follow.\" While he was a congressional candidate in 2010, one of his campaign aides sent a tweet linking to an article that labelled his Indian-American Democratic opponent Raj Goyle a \"turban topper\". Mr Pompeo apologised; his campaign also sent out billboard ads urging everyone to \"vote American\". He also served on the House Select Benghazi Committee, a special panel created in 2014 to investigate the deadly attack two years earlier on a US diplomatic compound in Libya. Democrats described it as a political witch hunt against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mr Pompeo released a report afterwards accusing her of intentionally misleading Americans about the nature of the attack to help President Barack Obama's re-election bid."

Dedryck Boyata was sent off for a last-man tackle on Accies' Carlton Morris five minutes before the break. Michael McGovern saved a second Griffiths spot-kick, and Brophy's powerful strike rescued Accies a point. They move above Motherwell into ninth in the Premiership table, two points above the relegation play-off place currently occupied by Kilmarnock. Celtic extend their cushion at the top of the table to seven points, but Aberdeen can take advantage of the champions' slip-up by closing the gap back to four points when they host St Johnstone on Saturday. Hamilton were a world away from January's humiliating 8-1 thrashing at the hands of the same opponents, and very nearly took the lead through Ali Crawford. Scott Brown lost out to Morris who put in Crawford though on goal, but he shot over the bar when he really should have scored. Accies had settled into the game after an dominant opening period from the visitors, but fell behind due to a moment of madness from Imrie. Griffiths was in possession but in an unthreatening position and only Imrie will know why he sent the Celtic striker crashing just inside the area. The striker took the penalty himself and fired the ball right down the middle. It was a crazy moment from Imrie, a point Mikey Devlin was presumably making as he squared up to his team-mate in the wake of incident. But suddenly the game was alight. Boyata was sent off for a tackle on Morris. He tried to play the Accies striker offside but mistimed his movement and the forward was in on goal. The lunging challenge ended a clear goalscoring opportunity just outside the box, but the Celtic bench - and their support in a crowd of 5,017 - clearly felt the tackle was legitimate and the defender had touched enough of the ball. Manager Ronny Delia immediately reshaped his 10 men, replacing the returning Kris Commons with Charlie Mulgrew. The flames continued to burn in the second half. Gary Mackay-Steven was through one-on-one with McGovern but could not finish, and Griffiths saw a clever effort fly just past the post. Then came another moment of controversy and another penalty. Ziggy Gordon was spotted wrestling with Mikael Lustig at a corner and referee Craig Thomson pointed to the spot. Again Griffiths stepped up, but this time McGovern produced a fine, diving save to keep the outcome in the balance. It was a costly miss because minutes later home boss Martin Canning introduced Brophy - criticised by some after celebrating his goal in the recent thumping at Parkhead - and the substitute had the desired effect. Celtic failed to deal with a corner and when the ball dropped in the box to Brophy he smashed a finish high into the net to ensure honours were even at the end of a pulsating match."

Police say an investigation has been launched. At least eight Yanukovych allies have died suddenly in the last three months. Most of the deaths are said to have been suicides. However, officials say it was possible some were killed or forced to take their lives. Commentators in Ukraine have accused supporters, as well as opponents, of the current pro-Western government of involvement in the deaths. The BBC's David Stern in Kiev says no motive has emerged linking the deaths and no arrests have been made. Mr Kalashnikov was a former deputy in parliament and a member of Mr Yanukovych's Party of Regions. Accounts of his death differ, with some sources saying his body was found outside his flat in Kiev and others saying it was found within. Mr Yanukovych fled Ukraine in February last year, after months of increasingly violent protests against him, centred on the Maidan, Kiev's main square. He later reappeared in Russia. The government that succeeded him reversed his opposition to closer ties with the European Union - a major factor behind the protests. It has since been plunged into a conflict with pro-Russian separatist rebels in the country's east."

Led by head teacher Dame Sally Coates, the inquiry will report early in 2016. It will also consider the greater use of technology and the \"direct engagement\" of employers in shaping prisoners' learning. Prison Reform Trust director Juliet Lyon said: \"Providing people with the knowledge and skills to help them lead a law-abiding life on release should be a central aim of a modern and effective penal system.\" Mr Gove said: \"We have more than 80,000 adults in our custody. \"One of the most important things we can do once they are inside the prison walls is to make sure that they get the literacy and numeracy skills they need to make them employable and positive contributors to society once released. \"For those serving longer sentences, education and training is a key part of their rehabilitation. \"We must have the right incentives for prisoners to learn and for prison staff to make sure that education is properly prioritised. \"I want to see prisoners motivated to engage in their own learning, and governors with the right tools to be more demanding and creative about the education provided in the prisons they run. \"I have seen some excellent examples of innovation and visionary organisations providing prisoners with education opportunities and qualifications they actually need to help secure a job on release. But I want to see more.\" In a speech in July to the Prisoner Learning Alliance, Mr Gove called for an end to the \"idleness and futility\" of prison life. He said the inability of prisoners to read properly or master basic mathematics made them prime candidates for reoffending. A system of \"earned release\" would be a major change from the current policy where most prisoners are automatically released on licence half way through their sentences. In July, Mr Gove said he recognised \"technical and complex policy questions\" about how such a change could be implemented."

But of course, there is a long line of people behind him who have been fired or eased out of their jobs by President Trump. Here's a run-down of what they did, and why they left, starting with \"The Mooch\". The brash, Wall Street big wig has known President Trump for years, and charismatically defended him in TV interviews. Although he didn't last long in the job, he made big headlines. He appeared to accuse Chief of Staff Reince Priebus of being responsible for White House leaks in a tweet (later deleted) that also appeared to threaten him. Mr Scaramucci then attacked Mr Priebus and President Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon in an expletive-filled rant on the phone with a reporter from the New Yorker magazine. Why was he sacked? Although he had boasted of reporting directly to the president, Mr Scaramucci's ill-discipline may have cost him any post alongside President Trump's new chief of staff - retired, four-star General John Kelly. Mr Scaramucci's departure was announced hours after Mr Kelly was sworn-in to replace Mr Priebus. The White House said Mr Trump believed comments Mr Scaramucci had made were \"inappropriate\". Time in post? Ten days. (Though his official start date was 15 August - so possibly minus-15 days.) The former Republican National Committee chairman was one of few Washington veterans given a top role in the Trump White House but was unable to assert his authority. He grappled with competing powers in an administration where Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, play key roles. Mr Scaramucci was hired despite Mr Priebus's disagreement and insulted him seemingly without reproach from the president. Why was he sacked? President Trump lost confidence in him and clearly wanted a shake-up in the White House, opting for a general to replace the Republican Party operative, who was seen as weak. The announcement also came as the Republicans failed in their efforts to repeal Obamacare in the Senate. Time in post? Six months. Mr Spicer famously kicked off his tenure as White House press secretary by defending a seemingly indefensible claim about the crowd size at President Trump's inauguration. Over the course of his time behind the podium, he became - unusually for a press secretary - a household name, and was parodied on Saturday Night Live. Why did he leave? Unlike most others on this list, Mr Spicer appears to have left on seemingly good terms with the president. He stepped down after Mr Scaramucci was appointed to a role he had partially filled, saying he did not want there to be \"too many cooks in the kitchen\". Sarah Huckabee Sanders had also taken over many of Mr Spicer's press briefings. The New York Times reported that Mr Spicer had \"vehemently\" disagreed with the appointment of Mr Scaramucci, which he believed to be a \"major mistake\". Time in post? Six months."

But he said Labour would not back a \"kamikaze\" exit which hurt the economy. Some shadow ministers have suggested they would quit if forced to vote for kick-starting official EU exit talks. Dozens of Labour MPs who support remaining in the EU could be willing to defy the leadership if it whips them into voting for Brexit in the event of a Commons vote which could take place in the coming weeks. The government has said it will notify the EU of its decision to leave, beginning two years of talks about the terms of exit, by the end of March. Whether Parliament is asked to approve the Article 50 decision hinges on a Supreme Court ruling, due on Tuesday, into whether MPs and peers are required to have their say. The Labour leadership have been accused of \"dithering\" over their approach and are under pressure to clarify whether they will oppose the government's plan of leaving the single market and the customs union and restricting EU migration. Mr McDonnell said the debate was polarised between those who wanted to overturn the referendum result and, on the other hand, those who backed a so-called hard Brexit and saw the UK's future outside the EU as a virtual tax haven. Labour, he suggested, stood between these two poles and supported a negotiated settlement with the EU to protect jobs, wages and living standards. \"Jeremy Corbyn has taken a rather courageous position in that he recognises that you have to bring the country together at some stage and it will be over a traditional British compromise,\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. \"Somewhere along the line there will be a sensible compromise and it will be Labour that is driving that compromise.\" Asked whether Labour MPs would be whipped to support the Article 50 process, he said the opposition had made it clear all along the referendum vote must be honoured. But he said Labour would seek to amend any government plans to guarantee the fullest scrutiny in Parliament and enable MPs from all parties to \"influence the negotiations\". Speaking on Sky News, Mr Corbyn said he would \"ask\" Labour MPs to respect the result while asked explicitly whether Labour wanted to stay in the single market, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told the BBC's Sunday Politics that \"in terms of jobs and the economy, of course we should be\". Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader who is now the party's Brexit spokesman, said Labour had suffered a \"catastrophic loss of nerve\" over Europe. \"This absolute lack of clarity from Labour on the biggest issue of our times - dithering helplessly in the middle of the road - is only going to make their fate even worse.\" While he expected ministers to win any vote on Article 50, he told Andrew Marr he expected Theresa May to run into trouble if she \"digs her heels in\" in during"

Arcadia's company secretary has written on behalf of Sir Philip saying she was given advance notice of the sale. The regulator's spokesman said she had known but with too few details. The spokesman said: \"We did discuss the proposed terms of a potential deal with trustees and the employer, however, we were not given sufficient information at that time to assess the potential impact on the BHS pension scheme.\" He added: \"As we have launched an anti-avoidance investigation we need to take care not to prejudice our case.\" BHS was sold for a \u00c2\u00a31 in March 2015 to a little known group of businessmen called Retail Acquisitions. It collapsed into administration two weeks ago with debts of \u00c2\u00a31.3bn and two parliamentary committees are investigating it. The letter to the Work and Pensions Committee and the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee said the regulator had been notified by email on 6 February, 2015 that a decision had been taken to market the sale of BHS. She was also informed that \"two parties had already expressed an interest in a solvent transaction and that negotiations were ongoing with both of them\", according to the letter. It goes on to say that later in February 2015, the BHS pension scheme trustees and their advisers were made aware of the terms of the proposed sale and met the proposed purchaser. The letter also states that Sir Philip understood that the trustees had discussions about the sale with the regulator at the beginning of March. The regulator then sought an urgent meeting to find out how the proposed sale could affect the BHS pension schemes. The letter said a meeting between Sir Philip and The Pensions Regulator took place on 4 March, where they were made aware of the \"key terms\" of the sale. The regulator's spokesman said: \"When addressing the Work and Pensions Select Committee, Lesley Titcomb said that we were not informed of the confirmation of the actual sale of BHS to Retail Acquisitions Ltd until March 11. \"She explained that we were engaged with the trustees and the employer in the weeks leading up to the sale, and that we were aware a sale was a possibility.\" During the lengthy parliamentary session, Ms Titcomb said she was unable to answer specific questions about BHS because of her continuing investigation. Her team is looking into whether BHS' previous owners had avoided their financial obligations to the pensions schemes. The letter also responded to questions raised by some MPs about the amount of dividend payments paid out by BHS. The letter said that a total of \u00c2\u00a3423m had been awarded to directors but that there had been no payments made for the past 12 years. The payments reflected the \"significant\" profits the business had made for the three years to the end of 2004. Former Trustees of the BHS pension scheme are due to appear before"

Mr Francis told BBC Wales his hereditary spastic paraplegia had worsened, but he had been reassessed to a lower level of benefits in which he was no longer eligible for a car under the Motability scheme. He said he had phone calls from Motability and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) on Thursday to tell him his case had been reassessed again - in his favour - after it was raised in the House of Commons on Wednesday. \"It's great that I can keep the car - too bad I only got it by getting Peter Hain to ask questions in Parliament,\" he said. \"How many other disabled people haven't done that?\" Mr Hain is trying to find out the reason for the change as he believes other people on disability benefits may be affected by changes to the regulations. A DWP spokesman said: \"If claimants disagree with a decision then they can seek to have it reviewed and submit new evidence. \"Mr Francis followed this process and when the new evidence was taken into account was awarded a higher rate of benefit. \"This enables him to retain his Motability car.\""

The CMA also said the firms were \"unfairly holding onto people's money\". Online gambling companies should \"play fair\", said the CMA. Nisha Arora, CMA senior director for consumer enforcement said: \"New customers are being enticed by tempting promotions only to find the dice are loaded against them. \"And players can find a whole host of hurdles in their way when they want to withdraw their money.\" Online gambling: What's the catch? The CMA launched its investigation into the gambling sector in October 2016. It has since heard from about 800 \"unhappy\" customers and has \"demanded companies answer questions about how they operate, and closely examined the play on a range of websites\". As a result it has identified \"a number of operators engaging in practices likely to be breaking consumer law\", which is why it is taking enforcement action. The controversial promotions involve terms and conditions which prevent punters from walking away from play with their winnings at a point of their choosing. For example, someone might bet \u00a310 of their own money which is then matched by \u00a310 from the online betting company. However, in the terms and conditions of play it might state that the customer has to play several hundred times within a certain period of time before they can cash in their winnings. In some instances, under these \"wagering requirements\" people have amassed winnings of several thousand pounds but they have had to keep on betting, said the CMA, meaning that their chances of losing money increase. \"They don't have the choice to quit while they're ahead and walk away with their winnings when they want to,\" the CMA said. The Remote Gambling Association (RGA), whose members include many online gambling firms, said it would take \"some time to digest and consider properly\" the CMA announcement. \"However, where failings are identified companies individually will rectify them,\" it added. \"If there are generic lessons to be learned then, as ever, we will work with the Gambling Commission to bring those to the attention of the wider industry with a view to raising standards across the board.\" Initially the CMA is talking to the companies involved, which it says it cannot name, demanding that they change their practices. If they do not meet the requirements, the CMA can take them to court. The court could fine the companies or ultimately revoke their licences. The Gambling Commission has been working alongside the CMA on the investigation. It said identity checks were an \"important duty\" for the gambling industry to \"prevent money laundering and to ensure responsible gambling\". But, it added, concerns had been raised that some operators might be \"applying these requirements in a restrictive way, preventing consumers from legitimately withdrawing funds from their gambling accounts\". The online gambling sector has grown by about 150% since 2009 and is worth \u00a34.5bn. The CMA said more than 6.5 million people regularly use the sites."

He said he lived off his savings while trying to solve his addiction problems. The jury heard that on the day of the policeman's death, Mr Brizzi and PC Semple took drugs together and engaged in sexual activity. Mr Brizzi said PC Semple appeared to be \"very happy\" to be with him and told the jury the police officer said he wanted to \"explore some extreme fantasies\".

PC Barker has been awarded the force's John Egerton Trophy.

More than 3,000 people signed books of condolence in Liverpool, the star's home city, following her death. The funeral cortege will start at the junction of Woolton Road and Church Road North, and will travel to the junction with Blackwood Avenue before continuing to the church. The family said the public would not be able to access the church grounds and asked people not to travel to Woolton village as \"as this may compromise the funeral party and invited guests from attending\". After the funeral, the entertainer's body will be laid to rest at a private ceremony in Allerton Cemetery, where her parents are buried. Some parking and traffic management restrictions will be in place on the day: Black, who made her name as a pop singer in the 1960s before becoming the host of hit TV shows Blind Date and Surprise Surprise, died after a fall at her villa in Estepona on the Costa del Sol.

      "text": "The animals cup their mouths when they produce kiss squeaks - alarm calls that often signify a predator is nearby. Researchers have now studied the acoustics of these \"hand-modified kiss squeaks\" and shown that the animals sound bigger and \"more impressive\" when they use their hands in the call. The findings are published in the Journal of Experimental Biology. If the orangutans do this deliberately - knowing it exaggerates their size - the researchers think it may be a glimpse of an early precursor to language; an animal intentionally changing a sound it makes and, in turn, changing its meaning. This same team of scientists - from the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK - first noticed that the apes changed their kiss squeaks with their hands back in 2009. But that change they spotted was very subtly different, so the team decided to analyse it in much more depth, to understand exactly what effect it had on the orangutan's voice. Lead researcher Bart de Boer from the University of Brussels, an expert in bioacoustics, worked out that the animals' hands were creating what he called a \"a cylindrical extension of the lips\". \"This has the same effect as lengthening the sound box of a musical instrument,\" he explained, \"so you get resonance of the lower pitches\". In short, this makes a kiss squeak sound like it is coming from the puckered lips of a bigger orangutan. \"So they aren't doing this for nothing,\" said Dr de Boer, \"It makes them sound more impressive.\" Dr de Boer's main scientific interest is the evolution of speech. By applying detailed acoustic examination of the sounds these great apes produce, he says that researchers are gradually piecing together the puzzle of how language developed. But, he said, \"there is still a lot to be found out\". \"It's unlikely that they're [making themselves sound bigger by accident], but it's still possible,\" Dr de Boer cautioned. Wild orangutans can be tricky to spot and study, so one research team is listening for their voices instead - using microphones in the forest to locate the animals. Brigitte Spillmann from the University of Zurich has developed a way to triangulate male orangutan \"long calls\" - a call often used to attract a mate - to work out their positions. \"Long calls can be heard up to 1km away, [so they're] a good candidate for this type of monitoring,\" says Ms Spillmann. \"With acoustic monitoring we know where, when and often who called or counter-called in the forest. \"This could help to improve our understanding of orangutans' social organisation and in particular their long-distance communication system.\" Dr Wendy Erb, an anthropologist from Rutgers University in New Jersey pointed out that non-human apes' gestural signals are thought to be more likely precursors to language because they are \"more flexible and intentional\" than vocal sounds. And the use of gestures in apes is well known. Recently, a team from the University of St Andrews published a study that attempted to translate the many gestures wild chimpanzees use. But, as Dr Erb pointed out,"

      "text": "The cross-party group said speaking English was \"the key to full participation in our society and economy\". They also said ministers should consider letting different parts of the UK set their own immigration policy. The government said it was spending \u00c2\u00a320m on English language provision. Last month a report by Dame Louise Casey warned of \"worrying\" levels of segregation in some areas and called for more English classes for isolated groups. The report by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration urges the government to go further, saying all immigrants should have either learnt English before coming to the UK or be required to sign up to classes when they arrive. The group said integration should begin upon arrival in the UK and described speaking English as a \"prerequisite for meaningful engagement with most British people\". The government has promised new migration controls once the UK leaves the EU but has not yet set out a detailed model. According to the cross-party group, \"substantial\" immigration powers should be devolved to the UK's nations and regions, with devolved governments or city regions setting quotas. 4.1m population increase 2001-11 50%+ of the increase is due to immigration 2.8m people in Britain are Muslim - the biggest religious group after Christians 70-85% of the populations in some wards in Blackburn, Birmingham, Burnley and Bradford are Muslim 511 schools in 43 areas take more than 50% pupils from Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds 27% of births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK It said replacing the current \"one-size fits all\" approach would lead to a \"more positive\" public debate about immigration. Addressing the \"economic and cultural needs\" of an area would \"have a positive knock-on effect on the public debate on immigration\", the report said, adding that this \"could instil confidence among members of the public that the immigration system works for their area, and give incentives for politicians to actively make the case for immigration in their area\". Pointing to a similar model in use in Canada, where provincial governments can set region-specific requirements for immigrants, it said visas could be issued specifically for certain regions or certain sectors. The report also called for a new national strategy to integrate immigrants, including \"awareness of the host country's laws, traditions and culture\" and access to the labour market, and for councils to set up local integration action plans. Net migration is well above the government's target of below 100,000, and ministers have said they will reduce it after the UK leaves the EU and is no longer subject to freedom of movement rules. Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who chairs the all-party group, said a \"meaningful\" integration programme would be needed when the rules are changed after Brexit. He said: \"It's clear that immigration has impacted on different communities in different ways and the pace of change has alarmed many. \"The government has a duty to address the lack of integration of immigrants if it is to address this. Failing to do so has left a vacuum for extremists and peddlers of hate to"

The party claims their pledged action would protect consumer interests. But the current regulator, Ofgem, said it already had the power to remove licences from energy firms in certain circumstances. \"Where firms fail to meet standards there must be tough and decisive action,\" said Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary. Labour has already promised to abolish Ofgem, and put a new regulator in place. An Ofgem spokesman said it already had powers to revoke licences in \"specific circumstances, including where companies have failed to comply with particular enforcement orders.\" However, a Labour spokesman said the current rules meant a firm could repeatedly break the law as long as it paid the fines issued by Ofgem. \"That's the kind of regulatory gap we want to address,\" he said. Energy UK, the trade body for the industry, said it already had strong penalties for companies found to be in breach of licence conditions. \"Having a strong set of licence conditions is essential for the protection of consumer rights,\" it said. Labour also revealed figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, which it said showed 16 energy companies faced probes into mis-selling, poor customer service and other bad practices. Ms Flint said the figures showed that the current government had \"presided over a broken energy market\". \"On David Cameron's watch, energy bills in Britain have risen twice as fast as inflation, four times faster than wages and faster than almost any other country in the developed world,\" she added. In response, a Conservative spokesman said the government was already taking action to address the issues raised, including forcing energy firms to simplify bills. \"We're carrying out a full, independent inquiry to fix the broken market we inherited,\" he added."

After Brexit, the UK would become a \"third country\" in EU terms, she said - meaning trade would be carried out based on World Trade Organisation rules until a new deal was complete. A recent trade deal with Canada took seven years to negotiate. The Canadian agreement will also require ratification by all EU countries, adding another one to two years before it takes effect. WTO rules restrict the circumstances in which countries discriminate in favour of each other in trade. Otherwise, they must apply to each other the tariffs they apply against the rest of the world. Ms Malmstrom, the EU Trade Commissioner, underlined that detailed talks to shape the UK's new trading relationship with the EU should not start until after the process of leaving politically, under an Article 50 process lasting up to two years. \"There are actually two negotiations. First you exit, and then you negotiate the new relationship, whatever that is,\" she said. \"The referendum - which of course we take note of and respect - has no legal effect. First there has to be notification, which the next prime minister will do, I hope swiftly. And then that process can start.\" There is concern in the City that having to do business for years under WTO rules could be disastrous for the UK's service industries. Asked whether sticking to such a process wouldn't harm the economies of all EU members, Ms Malmstrom replied: \"Yes, but the vote was very clear.\" She said she was \"saddened\" that the UK - which has traditionally defended the principle of free trade - is leaving the EU. Fearsome challenge Under EU law, the bloc cannot negotiate a separate trade deal with one of its own members, hence the commissioner's insistence that the UK must first leave. It is also against EU law for a member to negotiate its own trade deals with outsiders, which means the UK cannot start doing this until after it has left the EU. Taken at face value, these rules mean the UK cannot conduct its own trade talks for up to two years - a fearsome challenge to any prime minister trying to deliver Brexit. EU officials say the UK's options will soon refine themselves into a Norway-style package that keeps Britain within the single market - subject to EU rules and regulations - or a bespoke \"third country\" deal on the pattern of Canada's. They agree that because British businesses are already compliant with EU rules and regulations, choosing to remain within the single market would be \"a little quicker\", than negotiating a deal like Canada's. But even a Norway-style single market access deal, they caution, could take years to negotiate, leaving the UK trading on WTO terms in the meantime.

Thames Water apologised for any inconvenience caused and said its engineers brought in water from other areas of Berkshire to supply customers in Reading. The company warned that water may be discoloured when it first came back. It said it was \"harmless\" but advised customers to keep taps running until it cleared, and to inform the firm if it continued.

She was riding Polly in a field in Mathern, near Chepstow, Monmouthshire, when she was injured in 2012. Miss Harris, 18, of Lydney, Gloucestershire, is suing Mrs Miller at London's High Court. She claims Polly \"misbehaved\" and broke into a canter of her own accord, throwing her off in the process. But Mrs Miller says the horse was blameless and Miss Harris fell after losing her balance as she descended a \"short and gentle slope\". The court heard Ashleigh had been taken to a field on 22 September 2012 by Mrs Miller, the mother of her then boyfriend, Keiran Miller. Miss Harris described Polly as \"fidgety\" and said the thoroughbred mare had been nipping at her and others. She added: \"She then went to canter and I held her up because I didn't ask her to. She was throwing her head around and bucked, then I came out of the saddle and went over the horse's head.\" Her barrister, David Westcott QC, said she should never have been allowed into Polly's saddle as she had only ever ridden ponies. He also said the mare was \"bred for racing\" and had not been well schooled. Mrs Miller said the teenager fell as she was riding Polly at a walking pace down a hill in the field. She also said she spoke to Miss Harris's mother before letting her ride Polly and believed Ashleigh was a more experienced rider. Winston Hunter QC, for Mrs Miller, said: \"Ashleigh gave Keiran an impression that she was indeed a competent rider. \"There's no evidence Mrs Miller was aware that she had only ridden ponies.\" Judge Graham Wood QC will give his ruling on the claim at a later date."

      "text": "Mrs Foster said: \"We would like to see the petition of concern got rid of\". Any vote in the assembly can be made dependent on a petition of concern if it is supported by 30 MLAS - meaning the motion will only pass if it has cross-community support. The purpose is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another. Mrs Foster added: \"I think we need to talk about, maybe after the election, getting rid of the petition of concern altogether.\" If a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support. In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting. Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions. A valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs. Introduced as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the procedure was originally designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in the assembly. However, its use has become controversial, and the DUP have been criticised for using the mechanism to stop votes on same-sex marriage being passed, and for preventing motions of no confidence going through. According to figures compiled by an investigative website, The Detail, over a five-year period from 2011 to 2016 the petition of concern procedure was used 115 times. The DUP was the only party with more than 30 MLAS so it presented petitions without other party support. Over the five years, they signed 86 petitions, while the SDLP and Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in signed 29. The Green Party endorsed four, Alliance three, and the Ulster Unionists two. Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster made it clear that she wanted to see change \"We talk a lot about the petition of concern and our opponents talk a lot about the petition of concern,\" she said. \"We would actually like to see the petition of concern got rid of for everything, but I think our opponents would like to keep it for the things they want to to use the petition of concern for and not allow us to use it.\" Alliance Party leader Naomi Long has called for reform of the petition of concern. She said the veto was the main reason developments such as same-sex marriage had not yet been introduced in Northern Ireland. \"We need to get it back to its original intent and away from what it has become, which is used and abused to protect parties' selfish interests,\" Mrs Long said."

The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk. The Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit. Source: Crown Prosecution Service But Mr and Mrs Moores, from Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, also want the offence to be upgraded to a charge of manslaughter. Mr Moores said: \"Somebody can drive drunk and kill my son. Why is that not manslaughter? \"Nothing can prepare a parent for seeing their child in the mortuary. That will stay with me every day, every day that vision comes into my mind. \"Our life is ruined.\" Mrs Moores added: \"There's nothing careless about drink driving. I don't want anybody else to feel like us.\" Ms Hackett, who lived in Radnor Street, Swindon, at the time of the offence, appealed against her sentence in September 2011, but was refused. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"We are determined to make sure those who kill whilst driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs face the full force of the law. \"That is why we are consulting on plans that will see the maximum sentence for a number of offences in this area increase from 14 years to life.\" A response to the Ministry of Justice consultation, which closes on 1 February, is due to be published by May."

Lord Feldman insists he was not aware of any complaints before August 2015. Two activists involved in producing the document say it named Mark Clarke. Mr Clarke is the volunteer organiser at the heart of the bullying scandal which has bedevilled the party since September. He has been accused of bullying, sexually harassing and planning to blackmail other activists - allegations he has robustly denied. Patrick Sullivan, who runs a Conservative think tank, said hard copies of the 2010 dossier were handed to Lord Feldman and Tory co-chair Baroness Sayeeda Warsi. His testimony appears to contradict the account of Lord Feldman, a close friend and political ally of the prime minister. The Tory chairman has maintained consistently that he was \"wholly unaware\" of the allegations against Mr Clarke until August 2015. Mr Sullivan told Newsnight that Mr Howlett, MP for Bath, had decided to tackle widespread bullying within the party's young activists after being elected to a second term as chair of Conservative Future, the party's youth wing, in 2010. Mr Sullivan said: \"He had a strong anti-bullying stance in the campaign because there had been a culture of bullying. As soon as he was elected Ben [Howlett] and myself helped compile a dossier and that dossier was given by Ben to Lord Feldman and Sayeeda Warsi.\" He said that complaints had been made to the party about Mr Clarke's behaviour even before 2010 when Mr Clarke was removed from the party's list of approved candidates. \"The dossier is not the only thing,\" Mr Sullivan said. \"There were complaints about Mark Clarke in 2008. So complaints about Mark Clarke had been something that Conservative Central Office have known about for a very long time.\" Mr Sullivan said his own bullying at the hand of Mr Clarke seriously damaged his health: \"I got depressed. I felt I couldn't leave my home. I felt isolated.\" He said Mr Howlett had also been a victim of Mr Clarke's bullying. They assembled the dossier over the course of a week along with a third activist. It contained first person accounts from activists who had been bullied, alongside newspaper reports of bullying incidents which were already in the public domain. Mr Sullivan says he first challenged the culture of bullying in the party in 2008 after an 18 year-old woman was \"spectacularly\" bullied in the run up to a Conservative Future election. He said: \"Mark Clarke had a preferred candidate and as a result he started bullying and intimidating people who were opposing that candidate. That was when I first realised how bad he was.\" Mr Sullivan said he made a speech inside CCHQ attacking the bullying culture in front of Mr Clarke and others. \"As a punishment for making that speech I was isolated like a pariah,\" he said.

She expects the talks to take up to six weeks. The crisis has come about after a murder which the police say was carried out by the IRA - they were an armed group who wanted Northern Ireland to be part of a united Ireland separate from the UK. Sinn Fein is one of the biggest political groups in Northern Ireland. It traditionally had links to the IRA. The leaders of Sinn Fein insist that the IRA have \"gone away\". It's not clear what will happen if the political parties can not come to agreement. There might have to be a new election. At the moment people living in Northern Ireland won't be noticing any differences to their day to day services like schools and rubbish collections.

But Mr Watson told the Commons he was \"right to demand that guidelines were adhered to\", and said abuse survivors had been \"belittled for too long\". Lord Brittan died unaware that police had dropped a rape inquiry against him. The Crown Prosecution Service found in July 2013 that there was not enough evidence for a prosecution over the claim Lord Brittan had raped a 19-year-old female student in 1967. Mr Watson later called for a full review of all abuse allegations made against the peer, who died in January. Defending his conduct, Mr Watson told the Commons he was right to raise the issue. \"I understand MPs feel aggrieved Leon Brittan was interviewed by the police and they are angry with my use of language but I am sure they would also agree that when someone is accused of multiple sexual crimes by numerous completely unrelated sources the police have a duty to investigate, no matter who it is,\" he said. Mr Watson made reference to remarks made by Prime Minister David Cameron earlier, who urged him to \"examine his conscience\" over his actions, after Lord Brittan's brother called for an apology over \"unfounded accusations\". \"I think we all need to examine our consciences in this House, we presided over a state of affairs where children have been abused and then ignored, dismissed and then disdained. \"If anyone deserves an apology it is them,\" Mr Watson added, to cries of \"shame\" from the Conservative Party benches. Sir Nicholas, who had demanded an apology to Lord Brittan's family in a point of order, said afterwards that Mr Watson's statement was a \"non-apology\" and that his conduct was \"completely unacceptable\". \"He has become the witch-finder general,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \"I really do think we have got to bring some order to this debate which is running out of hand.\" Meanwhile, BBC News has obtained a letter written by Mr Watson to the Director for Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders in April 2014 about the rape allegation against Lord Brittan. In the letter he said he was \"driven to the unpalatable conclusion that the identity of the alleged perpetrator - Leon Brittan - may in some way have influenced treatment of the case\". Mr Watson also made it clear he was writing the letter following complaints from the alleged victim over the way the case had been handled and urged Ms Saunders to look at it again. The BBC also understands that four Conservative MPs have asked Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz to put Mr Watson's actions on the agenda when it meets on Tuesday. The prime minister told LBC radio: \"The House of Commons select committees are quite rightly going to ask him some questions so I'm sure he should answer those questions and examine his conscience about whether he's said enough so far.\" On Friday Mr Watson admitted he should not have repeated a claim that Lord Brittan was \"close to"

The November article described a gang rape at a University of Virginia (UVA) fraternity house in 2012. A four-month police investigation found no evidence that the incident occurred. However, police chief Timothy Longo has said that did not mean \"something terrible didn't happen\" to the student known as Jackie. In a statement, UVA's chapter of Phi Kappa Psi said they would \"pursue all available legal action against the magazine\". The chapter said its members were ostracised and the fraternity house was vandalised as a result of the article, which was read by millions. The Columbia School of Journalism report, commissioned by Rolling Stone, described the article as \"a story of journalistic failure\". Written by journalist Sabrina Erdely, the 9,000-word article A Rape on Campus relied on Jackie as the sole source to tell the story of an alleged rape at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house. Subsequent investigations by other reporters and Ms Erdely herself identified errors in the reporting of the piece. Rolling Stone has apologised and officially retracted \"A Rape on Campus\" after the review. Managing Editor Will Dana apologised to readers and \"all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout\". The Columbia School of Journalism report said the magazine failed to use \"basic, even routine journalistic practice\" to verify the details after Ms Erdely failed to contact the alleged attackers. \"The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking\", and there were \"systematic failures\" at the magazine, the report said. The report went on to suggest that the article had undermined work to stop sexual violence as it \"spread the idea that many women invent rape allegations\". During a press conference on Monday, Steven Coll, one of the authors of the report, said Rolling Stone had hid behind sensitivity to Jackie to explain their lapses in reporting. \"We do disagree with any suggestion that this is Jackie's fault,\" Mr Coll added. Mr Dana described the report as \"painful reading\", and said the magazine was committing itself to a series of recommendations in the report, but said no-one would be fired for their involvement in the story. He apologised to all those affected by the story, \"including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students\". Columbia said that Jackie had declined to answer questions for the report and that her lawyer said it \"is in her best interest to remain silent at this time\"."

There's no need to concentrate on the appearance.\" For someone who has worked in the tea industry for more than 50 years, Anglo-Indian businessman Nirmal Sethia has lost none of his passion for the drink. Now in his 70s, he also still takes tea very seriously. \"Tea is life,\" he says. \"Tea is religion, tea is music.\" The co-founder and boss of upmarket brand Newby Teas, Mr Sethia's relationship with tea started in London after the end of World War Two. However, Mr Sethia, the son of a successful third-generation Indian businessman, initially just wanted to have fun in life. Looking back on his teenage years, he says: \"I was a rebel. \"I used to see all the boys smoking in London and wanted some of that. Smoking, and drinking, and girls looked exciting to me, even at 13.\" It was then that he told his father that he didn't want to go to school any more. \"I knew that route wasn't for me. I didn't want to do exams, and wanted something more exciting.\" A chance encounter one day with someone who worked in a tea supplier led to Mr Sethia becoming an apprentice tea taster for one of the biggest tea merchants in London, something he believes was the hand of God guiding him. \"It was my first lucky break,\" he says. \"Divine intervention I suppose. \"Someone I knew saw me smoking outside the tea offices, and seemed to see something in me. He worked there and introduced me to the boss.\" That first encounter on a London street in the late 1950s started a lifelong love affair with tea for Mr Sethia. He was soon working for one of biggest tea importers in the Republic of Ireland as a buyer in India, tasked with buying tea at auctions in Kolkata (formerly called Calcutta). His father was impressed with how his son had taken to working in the tea industry, and encouraged him to do more. So with his dad's support, the young Nirmal Sethia started his own business - Sethia Tea Estates - from the family's home in Kolkata, buying and selling teas from all over the world, for tea merchants the length and breadth of the UK and Republic of Ireland. By then tea had really taken over his life, and Mr Sethia bought a tea plantation in the north eastern Indian state of Assam. \"I didn't have any money [left over]... I used to sleep on the veranda of one of the buildings in the tea garden and drink tea,\" he says. \"I taught myself about the different characteristics and subtleties in flavour. I seemed to have a gift for tasting tea. I was able to distinguish and discern teas from different parts of India and beyond, something that impressed the buyers I met.\" Having made a success of his tea business, Mr Sethia's destiny took a different path in 1965 when he started his own company dealing in jute, a vegetable fibre used to make rope and bags. He says:"

Nine crew members and 161 passengers were on board. A federal official quoted by the Associated Press news agency said the plane appeared to have suffered a rare and serious type of engine failure in which parts break off and are spewed outside the engine. Passengers reported an explosion followed by flames and black smoke as the plane was speeding down the runway. Sarah Ahmed said everyone on the right side of the plane rushed from their seats and moved to the left side. \"People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door,\" she told WLS-TV. \"Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows.\" The incident took place at 14:35 local time (19:35 GMT). An initial statement by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the plane had burst a tyre, but that information was later deleted from the statement. Why do people grab their bags after a plane crash? American Airlines said passengers who still wanted to travel had been put on another flight to Miami.

It warns that too often the traditional relationship between the employer and the person being trained has been lost. The government welcomed the report and said it would respond in due course. There has been a rapid increase in the number of apprenticeships in England in recent years, with successive governments urging young people to consider them instead of university. But there are concerns about quality, with some as short as three months. Entrepreneur Doug Richard was asked by Business Secretary Vince Cable and Education Secretary Michael Gove to consider the future of apprenticeships in England. In his review, Mr Richard says \"apprenticeships or the notion of them are popular\", but that this has led to many things being called apprenticeships which, in fact, are not. \"Simply enough, not all instances of training on a job are apprenticeships,\" he says. They \"require a new job role, a role that is new to the individual and requires them to learn a substantial amount before they can do that job effectively,\" he said. As a consequence, he says, the nation risks losing sight of the core features of what makes apprenticeships work. And he suggests they should last for at least a year, adding that those \"measured in weeks or months\", can still \"fall short\". He adds that while the knowledge required for a job could be covered in a shorter period of time, it took time for \"the individual to transform from an apprentice to a skilled worker\". This comes after numerous complaints that some agencies and businesses have been offering low grade apprenticeships that only last for a few weeks or even months, in exchange for cheap labour and government funding. He is clear that training to improve the skills of someone who has been in their job for some time or someone who is not yet ready to start work should not be called an apprenticeship. He warns that that the relationship between the employer and the trainee is being lost, as schemes have become government-led training initiatives, shaped by training professionals, rather than employers. He calls for a new set of qualifications which set out what a person should be able to do and know at the end of their training. But they must also offer a set of skills broad enough for other jobs. He said these new qualifications should be redefined by employers who should set the standard, rather than ministers. They should be free of the \"bureaucratic box ticking assessment\" and \"micro-level\" prescription that he says is a feature of current vocational qualifications. \"It is complicated and off-putting to an employer to have to undertake paperwork gymnastics to pigeonhole their system into a redefined set of curricular approaches,\" he adds. He calls for the apprentice's accomplishments to be robustly tested and validated, and says they must include high quality attainments in maths and English for those who have not got GCSEs in the subjects before they start. And he"

Ridley Scott hit The Martian was named best comedy or musical film, winning a further Globe for star Matt Damon. Room star Brie Larson was named best actress in a drama, while Jennifer Lawrence won best comedy actress. British winners included Kate Winslet, picking up the best supporting actress award for her role in Steve Jobs, as the Apple guru's assistant; singer Sam Smith, for his Bond track Writing's On The Wall, and the BBC's adaptation of Wolf Hall was named best mini-series. But hopefuls Eddie Redmayne, Dame Helen Mirren, Dame Maggie Smith and Idris Elba missed out. Mark Rylance, who - like Elba - was nominated in both the TV and film categories, was tipped to win the best supporting actor Globe for his role in Bridge of Spies, but lost out to Sylvester Stallone for his comeback performance as Rocky Balboa in Creed. \"I was here in 1977 and I was hit by tumbleweed - and the view is so beautiful now,\" said Stallone, who received a standing ovation. Steve Jobs picked up the award for Aaron Sorkin's screenplay - making the biopic the only other multiple film winner of the night. There were no awards for Todd Haynes's critically acclaimed love story Carol, nor for the much admired Spotlight. There was also nothing for George Miller or his Mad Max reboot Fury Road, nor did The Big Short or The Danish Girl make good on any of their nominations. As widely predicted, Pixar's Inside Out won best animated film and veteran Italian composer Ennio Morricone won his third Golden Globe for Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight. In the television categories, the streaming services' original dramas Mr Robot and Mozart in the Jungle won awards. Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal was named best actor in a comedy or musical TV series for his role as brash conductor Rodrigo in Mozart in the Jungle, and Christian Slater won the best supporting actor in a series for Mr Robot - shutting out British star Damian Lewis (Wolf Hall) and Alan Cumming (The Good Wife). Having missed out on an Emmy in September, Empire star Taraji P Henson was named best actress in a TV drama series and Mad Men's Jon Hamm picked up his second best actor Golden Globe for Mad Men - eight years after winning his first at the start of the series. But, in an otherwise disparate night, the evening belonged to Alejandro G Inarritu's survivalist tale The Revenant - and the combined power of Inarritu's direction and DiCaprio's visceral performance. The victory comes just a year after Inarritu lost the best director prize to Richard Linklater, when Inarritu's Birdman faced off with Linklater's Boyhood - though Inarritu went on to win the Oscar. It must also put DiCaprio centre stage for the Oscar that has eluded him throughout his career. \"This has been the most difficult journey I have embarked upon,\" said Inarritu, receiving his award. \"But we all, in"

The Senior race was immediately red flagged by the clerk of the course. Firth finished 34th in the Newcomers A race earlier this week and had recorded his fastest lap of 102.282mph in the Friday's Senior race. Organisers the Manx Motor Cycle Club said they pass on their \"deepest sympathy to his family and friends\". The Coroner of Inquests has been informed and an investigation into the circumstances of the accident is under way. Two other riders were involved in the incident but were reported as ok by organisers. In a separate incident Alun Thomas crashed at Alpine Cottage and was taken by helicopter to hospital where he was reported to have \"multiple fractures\" but is in a \"stable condition\". Clerk of the course Phil Taubman confirmed the race would not be rerun and the result has been declared at the end of the second lap. It means Loughborough's Andrew Soar, who led the race after two laps (the last completed by the whole field), has been awarded the victory ahead of Michael Moulai with Rob Hodson third. All three riders, who were contesting the lead when the race was red flagged, said their thoughts were with those involved in the earlier accidents. Although the roads were mainly dry, riders were warned about possible damp patches at Laurel Bank, Ramsey Hairpin, Hillberry and the Nook as well as strong winds, particularly on the Mountain section of the course. The subsequent Manx Grand Prix reunion parade has been cancelled and all roads are now open around the course. Three riders have lost their lives at this year's Isle of Man Festival of Motorcycling, which incorporates the Classic TT and Manx Grand Prix."

Doug Black, medical director for NHS England in Nottinghamshire, said it was the \"largest recall in NHS history\". He said: \"We are doing our level best to meet demand, but to avoid waiting, people can book an appointment for another time and come back.\" Mr Black said it was important people attended the Highcroft Medical Centre, in Arnold, rather than going elsewhere. \"The samples we are taking are being sent to a dedicated laboratory, which enables us to track the results,\" he added. The death of a woman treated at the practice in Daybrook, Nottinghamshire is also being investigated by police. Amy Duffield died in August 2013 shortly after being treated by the dentist. NHS England said it appeared Mr D'Mello failed to wash his hands and used the same instruments for more than one patient without sterilising them between appointments. Experts said the risk of infection was believed to be low and Mr D'Mello had been tested and was clear of all diseases. A Care Quality Commission inspection in July also raised concerns about the possibility of cross-contamination at the practice. However, inspectors who had visited the clinic in November last year, gave it a clean bill of health. The new owners of the practice have renovated the property and addressed all the concerns, the inspectors said. Nottinghamshire Police was asked by the coroner to investigate Miss Duffield's death. Miss Duffield, a Leeds University graduate, died in hospital in August 2013 of viral acute myocarditis after suffering palpitations, her family said. Her mother Sharon Duffield said: \"We will of course be interested in the findings of the investigation, whatever the outcome, but it won't bring Amy back.\" Test results are expected to be available in 14 days."

Raymond Aubrac and his late wife Lucie became important members of Jean Moulin's underground Resistance movement in 1942. Aubrac was arrested in June 1943 with Moulin, who died after torture. In a recent BBC interview, he described how their arrests by the Gestapo at a doctor's surgery in the suburb of Caluire in Lyon had come as \"a shock but not a surprise\". Jean Moulin, who had been sent by Gen Charles de Gaulle to organise the underground resistance to Nazi occupation, was tortured, taken to Paris and later died on a train to Berlin. But Raymond Aubrac escaped when a group of fighters including his wife attacked a lorry moving him and other members of the Resistance from jail in Lyon. Born as Raymond Samuel in 1914, Aubrac was Jewish. He studied engineering and married Lucie Bernard after war broke out. After his escape from jail, the couple reached London in February 1944. Their story and their Resistance work with Jean Moulin became legendary in France and the couple gave a number of talks to schools and colleges about their experience. After France was liberated, Aubrac was given the task of supervising reconstruction efforts in the port city of Marseille. From 1964-75 he served as a director at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. He twice gave evidence after the war against Rene Hardy, a fellow Resistance member who was accused of betraying his colleagues but was later acquitted. In 2010, he travelled to London with President Nicolas Sarkozy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Gen de Gaulle's appeal to the French people after the country had fallen to the Nazis. Raymond Aubrac remained politically active until he died and gave his backing to Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande. In tribute, President Sarkozy described him as an \"heroic figure\" whose \"escape, thanks to the courage of his wife Lucie Aubrac, has entered into the legend of Resistance history\". Centrist presidential candidate Francois Bayrou praised him as a \"major emblematic figure\"."

They found no evidence of \"historic, systematic abuse\" but have reopened five unconnected cases, the force said. The review only included reports which are not linked to current investigations. A team of experts looked at reports into 866 individuals to decide if they had been victims of sexual exploitation. In cases where they had, they assessed whether the complaints had been properly investigated at the time. This uncovered further names - a total of almost 7,000 - all of which were followed up. Details of any potential victims were passed on to teams of detectives, who felt five cases warranted reopening. The report concluded: \"There is no evidence to suggest that any large scale systematic child sexual exploitation has been uncovered in Leicestershire\". Police and Crime Commissioner Sir Clive Loader, who ordered the report, known as Operation Sepia, said he was \"reassured\" by its findings. Assistant Chief Constable Roger Bannister said he was satisfied the \"comprehensive\" review would have uncovered any evidence of systematic and organised abuse if it had existed.

It recommended the Scottish government and NHS boards agree minimum safe staffing levels for all professions in hospitals. The Scottish government said NHS staffing was at its highest-ever level. The academy set up a working group to look at how the health service could learn from past failures. It followed three previous reports into serious failings of care in the Scottish health service. They looked at problems of staffing and leadership at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI); above-average mortality rates at NHS Lanarkshire; and the worst-ever outbreak of C-difficile infection, at Vale of Leven Hospital. The academy's report, Learning from Serious Failings in Care, identified key issues to be addressed, including: The working group was chaired by Prof Alan Paterson of Strathclyde University and involved senior experts from the Royal Colleges in Scotland. Prof Paterson said: \"It is clear that serious failings in team working between clinical staff and NHS management played a significant role in the failings in care identified. \"These failings are deep-rooted and systemic. They must not be ignored if we are to learn from them and to prevent repetition. \"It is also clear that a combination of factors led to some appalling failings in care, a loss of basic compassion and the prioritisation of inappropriate targets over patient care. In addition, leadership and accountability were all too often sadly lacking and bullying endemic. \"While there have been responses to the individual published reports of inquiries and reviews into failings in care, there is little evidence to suggest that we are tackling the underlying systemic failings which exist.\" The report recommended that hospital staffing levels should be based on \"best evidence\". It said priority should be given to developing minimum safe staffing for acute medicine and medicine for the elderly wards. Among its 20 recommendations was a suggestion that there should be less reliance on locum and agency staff, and a call for quality of care to be put ahead of meeting targets, It also raised concerns about staff sickness, saying this could be an indication of deteriorating morale and should be used as \"an early warning system\". Royal College of Nursing Scotland Director Theresa Fyffe said: \"These are hard-hitting recommendations and will make uncomfortable reading for many managers and leaders in our health service.\" She added: \"Too often, failures in care are down to unsafe staffing levels. We know that quality of care is inextricably linked to having the right number of suitably skilled staff in the right place at the right time, with the right balance between registered nurses and unregistered staff. \"Having appropriately trained and experienced staff must be a priority for all health boards if they are to deliver safe, high quality care to patients.\" The Scottish government's national clinical director for healthcare quality, Prof Jason Leitch, said: \"We are committed to driving up standards in our NHS which is why we have led the way in responding to the reports detailed in the Scottish Academy's report. \"We are absolutely clear"

One of the lionesses currently on the loose has left her cubs in the park, Mr Udoto said. Answering a question on Twitter from a worried mother, Mr Udoto advised her to keep her children inside until the lions had been safely returned to the park, adding such incidents were the \"perils of born town lions\".

Universities Minister Jo Johnson said the sale would have \"no impact on people with student loans\". But the National Union of Students said it was an \"ugly move on students\". \"It is outrageous that bankers will profit off the backs of graduates who took out loans because they had no other option,\" said the union's vice-president Sorana Vieru. The government has had a long-standing aim to sell the student loan book to private investors - with types of loans being sold in separate stages. Over the next four years it aims to dispose of the loans from before 2012, when tuition fees in England were trebled to \u00a39,000 per year. The slice of loans now being put on sale - dating from 2002 to 2006 - have a face value of \u00a34bn. The government is promising that there will be \"no changes to the terms and conditions\" for borrowers - so that rates of repayment for former students will remain the same. It means that interest on these student loans will become an income for private investors, but repayments will continue to be collected through taxation and the Student Loans Company. The Intergenerational Foundation think tank has calculated that a student borrowing for three years' tuition could pay back \u00a354,000 - before debts are cancelled after 30 years. The Universities Minister Jo Johnson says the sale of assets is part of the drive to bring \"public finances under control\". But he said it would \"only proceed once we are satisfied that it represents value for money for the taxpayer\". David Gauke, chief secretary to the Treasury, said it was the right time to start the sale process. \"This sale makes sense for taxpayers and will play an important contribution in our work to repair the public finances,\" he said. But John Pugh, the Liberal Democrats education spokesman, said: \"The Conservative Brexit fire-sale is well underway, as ministers scrabble around to sell just about anything that isn't nailed down.\" Earlier versions of student loans have previously been sold - but it is now approaching the point in which the bigger \"income-contingent loans\", introduced in 2006 when fees rose to \u00a33,000, will be the next in line for sale. The National Union of Students attacked the sale as \"economic illiteracy\" and warned that it would begin a process in which loans would have to be made more attractive to private buyers - at the expense of student borrowers. \"It doesn't just penalise students and graduates, it is taking money from the public purse which could and should be spent on services over the long term,\" said Ms Vieru. However, Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said that there was much \"misinformation\" about the sale of loans, and the key issue was making sure that the taxpayer received good value. \"What the government is doing may make"

That's the big worry for me.\" Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said: \"If you put yourself in the shoes of the medic, it's almost an impossible job. Would they want to return someone to the field of play if they have been taken off for an assessment now?\" In 2014 the head injury assessment (HIA) was introduced, replacing the shorter and less comprehensive pitch-side concussion assessment (PSCA). Any player who has suffered a head injury must have an HIA to determine whether they are fit to return to the field of play. But McCall feels teams should be able to bring back on players who have been substituted on tactical grounds, in the event of a replacement suffering concussion. \"For us coaches there is the possibility of being reduced to 14 men because a sub fails his concussion test,\" said McCall. \"That is a ludicrous state of affairs. We want player safety, but it should be like a blood bin and we should be able to bring a replaced player back on the field and make sure teams stay at 15.\" Baxter added: \"Everything is so grey, that to really protect yourself, you could easily see 10 HIAs in a game. We just have to be a bit careful about where it will end up.\" Wasps boss Dai Young said: \"The Willis case could set a dangerous precedent. Let's hope it doesn't go down that path, but we all have total trust in our medics. \"We are all fully aware of concussion, but it is putting a lot of pressure on our medics now, and putting them under the microscope.\" Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox."

Builders also hired more workers and ordered more supplies to deal with an increase in new projects. Economists said the sector was recovering after a slow start to 2017. \"A sustained rebound in residential building provides an encouraging sign that the recent a soft patch for property values has not deterred new housing supply,\" said Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit. \"Instead, strong labour market conditions, resilient demand and ultra-low mortgage rates appear to have helped boost work on residential development projects.\" The data contrasts with reports earlier this week suggesting greater caution by homebuyers and lenders. Building society Nationwide said house prices had fallen for a third consecutive in May - the longest run of decline since 2009, just after the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the Bank of England said loan approvals fell to a seven-month low in April. The latest Markit/CIPS construction reading was still much weaker than the post-crisis high of 64.6 seen in January 2014. However, the survey found there had been solid rises across the whole sector in May, including in civil engineering and commercial building. Input prices for construction firms also rose at the slowest pace for seven months, despite the prolonged weakness of the pound. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result suggested the Brexit vote's \"dampening influence on construction activity is fading\". But he added: \"Note, however, that the PMI has had to exceed 53 in the past to signal growth. \"May's PMI reading, therefore, is consistent with quarter-on-quarter growth in construction output of only about 0.5%.\""

It also reported a 16% jump in full year profit for 2012 to NT$94.8bn. Foxconn is the world's biggest contract electronics maker and Apple is one of its biggest clients. According to some estimates, orders from Apple account for almost half of Foxconn's total revenue. In the October to December quarter, Apple had sold 47.8 million iPhones, up from 37 million a year earlier. Meanwhile, the launch of iPad mini, also boosted sales of its tablet PCs - it sold 22.9 million iPads, compared with 15.4 million in the same period in 2011. However, the heavy reliance on Apple has also raised concerns that Foxconn's growth may slow in the coming months. Some analysts said the rapid rate of growth that smartphones and tablet PCs had seen in recent years could not be sustained. \"In most of the developed economies, smartphones are at a mature penetration stage and tablets are pretty close to being at that stage,\" said Andrew Milroy of consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan. Mr Milroy added that Apple had so far not been able to replicate the success it enjoyed in the developed economies in emerging markets. He explained that in the emerging economies, Apple products were still very expensive and out of reach for many consumers. At the same time, Apple is facing increased competition from other smartphone makers in those markets. \"They are being hammered by low-cost smartphones in countries such as China,\" he said. The fear is that if Apple's growth rate slows, it will have a knock on effect on suppliers such as Foxconn."

      "text": "The distinct language and genetic make-up of the Basque people in northern Spain and southern France has puzzled anthropologists for decades. One theory proposed that they were an unmixed pocket of indigenous hunters. Now, a study in PNAS journal suggests they descend from early farmers who mixed with local hunters before becoming isolated for millennia. The Basques have unique customs and a language - Euskera - that is unrelated to any other spoken in Europe, or indeed the world. Nestled in a mountainous corner of Atlantic Europe, they also show distinct genetic patterns to their neighbours in France and Spain. It seemed logical that they were representatives of an older layer of population settlement, but just how far back their roots went has been a topic of debate. Mattias Jakobsson from Uppsala University in Sweden analysed the genomes of eight Stone Age human skeletons from El Portal\u00c3\u00b3n in Atapuerca, northern Spain. These individuals lived between 3,500 and 5,500 years ago, after the transition to farming in southwest Europe. The results show that these early Iberian farmers are the closest ancestors to present-day Basques. Comparisons with other ancient European farmers show that agriculture was brought to Iberia by the same migrant groups that introduced it to central and northern Europe. These pioneers expanded from a homeland in the Near East, sweeping across Europe about 7,000 years ago to usher in the period known as the Neolithic. Once the farmers settled down, they mixed with local hunter-gatherers - the descendants of people who lived in Europe during the last Ice Age. Indeed, the El Portal\u00c3\u00b3n individuals had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than pioneer farmers from Germany, Hungary and Spain who lived several thousand years earlier. The new study also goes some way to explaining some of the differences between the Basques and their neighbours in France and Spain. After the initial farmer-hunter mixture was set, the ancestors of the Basques became isolated from surrounding groups - perhaps due to a combination of geography and culture. \"It's hard to speculate, but we've been working with Basque historians and it's clear from the historical record that this area was very difficult to conquer,\" Prof Jakobsson told BBC News. This means the Basque area was largely unaffected by subsequent migrations that shaped genetic patterns elsewhere in Europe. One of these movements occurred in the Bronze Age, when pastoralists from the Steppe - on the eastern periphery of the continent - travelled west en masse. This migration probably spread Indo-European languages across Europe, affecting the central and northern parts of the continent to a greater extent than the south. While the genomes of French and Spanish individuals showed evidence of this eastern genetic input, those of Basques did not. Another migration served to further differentiate Basques from their Spanish neighbours. In AD 711, a Muslim army crossed from North Africa into Iberia, beginning an occupation that lasted more than 700 years. Again, while a small amount of North African and Sub-Saharan ancestry can be detected in the Spanish, it is largely absent from the Basques. Previous studies have shown"

Students on \"low-quality courses\" could also face tougher entry rules. She promised councils \u00c2\u00a3140m to address migration pressures and moves to deport EU criminals for \"minor crimes\". In a wide-ranging speech, her first significant policy address since becoming home secretary in July, Ms Rudd also announced a further crackdown on illegal immigration through new powers to go after landlords, employers and banks that facilitate it. But the proposals were met with concern by business groups while Labour said they would be taken with a \"pinch of salt\" given the government's failure to meet immigration targets. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is still committed to reducing net migration to \"sustainable\" levels - taken to mean below 100,000 a year - even though David Cameron failed to meet the target between 2010 and 2015, with net migration recently exceeding 300,000. Ms Rudd, who campaigned to remain in the EU during the referendum, said immigration had brought benefits to the UK but the difference between those settling in the UK and those leaving was \"too substantial\" and that the Brexit vote had shown British people demanded action. Although this would not happen \"overnight\", she said only a substantial reduction could help \"change the tide of public opinion\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so once again immigration is something we can all welcome\". \"I come here today with a warning to those that simply oppose any steps to reduce net migration,\" she said. \"This government will not waver in its commitment to put the interests of the British people first \"Reducing net migration back down to sustainable levels will not be easy. But I am committed to delivering it on behalf of the British people.\" Launching a consultation on entry rules for foreign workers and students, Ms Rudd said the tests that employers had to undergo before recruiting from abroad had become \"tick-boxing exercises\" and too often resulted in British citizens being discriminated against. \"The test should ensure people coming here are filling gaps in the labour market, not taking jobs British people could do,\" she said. \"So I want us to look again at whether our immigration system provides the right incentives for businesses to invest in British workers.\" While she was committed to attracting the best students from around the world, she said the current system too often \"treated every student and university as equal\" with insufficient consideration given to the contribution they could make to the UK against the obligations they placed on the state. \"Foreign students, even those studying English Language degrees, don't even have to be proficient in speaking English. We need to look at whether this one-size-fits-all approach really is right for the hundreds of different universities, providing thousands of different courses across the country. \"And we need to look at whether this generous offer for all universities is really adding value to our economy. This isn't about pulling up the drawbridge. It's about making sure students that come here, come to study.\""

      "text": "Andorra had stunned Chris Coleman's side by taking a sixth-minute lead through Ildefons Lima's penalty, Andorra's first competitive goal since 2010. Bale headed Wales level 16 minutes later, though that did not spare Coleman the jeers of the furious travelling Welsh fans as the score remained 1-1 at half-time. Wales searched desperately for a winner, and their reprieve eventually came after 81 minutes when Bale curled in a beautiful free-kick to deny Andorra a first competitive point for nine years. Although a victory of any sort was welcome, the Welsh performance was distinctly unconvincing as they aim to qualify for the finals stage of a major tournament for the first time since the 1958 World Cup. There had been optimism leading up to this campaign, with Euro 2016 expanded from 16 to 24 teams for the first time and Wales drawn alongside Bosnia, Belgium, Israel, Cyprus and Andorra in their qualifying group. Wales could hardly have asked for a kinder opening fixture - a trip to an Andorran side who are ranked 199th in the world, 158 places below them in the standings, and have lost their last 44 competitive games. But to Wales' horror, the prospect of a first competitive win for Andorra since 2004 seemed soberingly real as the hosts took an unexpected lead. With Wales unable to clear from a long Andorran throw, Neil Taylor was adjudged to have pulled the shirt of Ivan Lorenzo. Prompted by Mitja Zganec - the additional assistant referee behind the goal - Slovenian referee Slavko Vincic pointed to the spot and Andorra captain Lima calmly converted by sending Wayne Hennessey the wrong way. While Wales' travelling contingent of around 1,500 were momentarily silenced, the other half of the 3,300-capacity Estadio Nacional roared in disbelieving rapture. The lead lasted only 16 minutes, as Bale headed into the bottom corner from a tantalising cross from left-back Ben Davies. Bale had inevitably been the focus of pre-match attention, with the \u00a385m Real Madrid winger expected to start as centre-forward. Coleman instead picked the world's most expensive footballer on his favoured right flank, but he showed the goalscoring instinct of a natural striker to nod Wales level. The visitors enjoyed near total domination of possession, albeit a little unsteadily at times as players familiarised themselves with the erratic bounce of Andorra's controversial 3G pitch. With the artificial surface's rubber pellets flying up every time the ball hit the ground, Wales made hard work of creating genuine scoring opportunities. Having been booed off the field at half time, Coleman sought to take the initiative by switching to a 3-5-2 formation at the beginning of the second half. There was more urgency to the Welsh performance after the restart, and Bale was the catalyst for the change in pace. He had a free-kick from distance saved by Ferran Pol and a long-range effort which fizzed just wide, while his cross was headed wide by Andy King. There were times when Wales' desperation to take the lead led to a loss of shape and rhythm, as players struggled to adapt"

The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the \"core funding\" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be \u00a31,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at \u00a31,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with \u00a31,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at \u00a31,354. \"The funding system is chaotic,\" says Byron Rhodes. \"It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,\" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? \"If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have \u00a350m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have \u00a3100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money.\" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about \u00a3300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got \u00a36.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a \u00a319m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run"

She used \u00a311,072 of NHS cash to pay her husband Stephen, 46, for work on an equality and diversity publication called Transform, which never existed. Her husband also changed his plea to admit fraud. More on the fraud case and other stories from Devon and Cornwall Former nurse Vasco-Knight, of Runcorn, Cheshire, shook and sobbed uncontrollably as she changed her plea to one of the two charges of fraud she faced. Recorder Don Tait adjourned sentence until March but warned the Vasco-Knights that a \"custodial sentence is a distinct possibility\". He told the jury: \"As far as Mrs Vasco-Knight is concerned, she has fallen a long way, hasn't she, but that is her responsibility.\" Vasco-Knight was CEO at the South Devon NHS Foundation Trust and the national lead for equalities for NHS England when the offence occurred. The newsletter was commissioned by her in April 2013 and produced by her husband's firm Thinking Caps that July, the court heard. But it was a \"sham\", cut and pasted from a research paper by the Kings Fund charity, said Gareth Evans, prosecuting. He said Vasco-Knight's failure to declare an interest in Thinking Caps was a criminal offence and a \"massive breach of trust and abuse of her position as chief executive\". Vasco-Knight later tried to blame Habib Naqvi, a senior manager in the NHS, for commissioning the newsletter. Mr Naqvi, 28, of Bristol, was cleared of two counts of aiding and abetting. The prosecution offered no evidence on the second fraud charge against Mrs Vasco-Knight of swindling \u00a39,000 from the NHS. She and her husband were released on bail to 10 March for sentencing. Sue Frith, managing director of NHS Protect, which conducted the investigation, said Vasco-Knight's meteoric career path had been \"an inspiration to so many\" and her fraud was a \"huge disappointment and shock to many\"."

In 2015, the authorities banned 11 popular pornography websites, saying many failed to protect children \"from information harmful to their health\". Analysis by Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring The decision was made following two separate court rulings, which said the websites \"spread pornography\". Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans \"the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects\". It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them. Access is usually blocked for violating the notoriously vague extremism legislation or child protection laws. Websites critical of the Kremlin have been blocked too, and at one point Wikipedia was blacklisted. Following the 2015 ban, one woman asked Roskomnadzor on Twitter whether it could recommend an alternative. The agency replied: \"You can meet someone in real life.\" On Tuesday, it said its earlier tweet was \"still relevant\". However, open rights campaigners have warned that local bans can be defeated. \"Blocking porn is the fastest way to ensure widespread adoption of censorship circumvention in your country,\" said Eva Galperin, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. One of the affected porn sites offered Roskomnadzor a premium subscription to its service, in exchange for lifting the ban. The government agency said it was \"not in the market\" for such an offer. Nadya Tolokonnikova, lead singer from punk band Pussy Riot, joked that the ban was \"a blow below the belt\"."

McGee is best known as the widow of magician Paul Daniels, while Burke won 2008's X Factor and is a West End star. Peacock has won two Paralympics sprinting gold medals and is the first celebrity hopeful to have a disability. His appearance follows that of former Royal Marine and fellow amputee Cassidy Little, who took part in a \"people's\" edition of Strictly in 2015 as well as that year's Christmas show. The new series of Strictly will begin with a launch show on BBC One on 9 September. Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman will return to host the first series not to have Len Goodman as a judge. Bruno Tonioli, Darcey Bussell and Craig Revel Horwood will instead be joined by international ballroom champion Shirley Ballas. Here is a complete rundown of the contestants for the show's 15th series: Debbie McGee found fame at the side of Paul Daniels on his TV magic show in the 1980s and went on to marry him. Her Strictly appearance comes seven years after her late husband took to the dancefloor on the show's 2010 edition. He died last year. Speaking of her own impending appearance, she said: \"The excitement is overwhelming. I can't stop smiling. It's been the hardest secret I have ever had to keep!\" Jonnie Peacock has won gold in the T44 100m at two Paralympics, two World Para Athletics Championships and two European Championships. But can he win the Strictly glitterball? The 24-year-old had his right leg amputated below the knee after contracting meningitis as a child. \"The opportunity to be the first contestant with a disability to take part in Strictly's main show was too good to turn down,\" he said. \"I've got no previous dance history outside of the occasional 'worm' at a mate's party and I know this will be a challenge and a new experience. \"I can't wait to see what I can achieve and how far I can push myself.\" Alexandra Burke took The X Factor by storm in 2008, with her winner's single Hallelujah selling more than a million copies. Since then, she's established herself on stage in such musicals as The Bodyguard and Sister Act. \"I love this show and have followed it from the beginning, so being able to be a part of it is just a dream come true for me,\" she said. \"I am very nervous as I am a singer not a dancer, but I am going to give this my absolute everything.\" Chizzy Akudolu left Holby City in June after five years. Before that, she had roles in The Inbetweeners, EastEnders, Silent Witness, Hollyoaks and Twenty Twelve. Viewers have already seen her strut her stuff in BBC One's Let's Sing and Dance for Comic Relief. She appeared with two Casualty stars earlier this year, finishing second with a routine set to Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk. She said: \"When I was 13, I made the finals of a disco dancing competition once"

He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: \"I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it.\" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: \"The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. \"They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other.\" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: \"My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. \"This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. \"He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind.\" Judge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports."

Not surprisingly, one of his greatest fans is his only living son, Ulf Lindberg, born from a brief affair the footballer had during a tour of Sweden in 1959. He never met his father but said proudly: \"There is no one like Garrincha. His playing style was and will always be unique.\" With his right leg pointing inwards and his left leg pointing outwards, Manuel Francisco dos Santos - Garrincha's real name - seemed more destined to end up in poverty and anonymity than in the pantheon of great footballers. But put a ball at his feet and Garrincha, which means \"the little wren\", demonstrated incomparable skill and is regarded by many as the greatest dribbler of all time. His biographer, Ruy Castro, described the man fans called \"the angel with bent legs\" as \"the most amateur footballer professional football ever produced\". Garrincha also had a talent for charming women and it was during a tour of Sweden with the Rio team Botafogo that he had a brief affair with Ulf's mother. She gave him up for adoption to a middle-class Swedish family when he was only nine months old. It was only at the age of seven that his adoptive parents told him that his father was Garrincha, who had 14 children through various relationships. But the meeting of father and son never happened. \"I very much regret never having met him,\" Ulf admitted. Ulf is in Stockholm this week as a special guest at the farewell friendly game between Brazil and Sweden on Wednesday at the Rasunda, the stadium where his father played in the final of the 1958 World Cup, the first of five Brazil have won. The arena is to be knocked down and its newer replacement has already been built in the same neighbourhood. \"Until today, I often find myself thinking how it would be nice to have known my father and say how much I admire him,\" Ulf told BBC Brasil. After a match in Gothenburg against the Russian team, the paper said he was an alien talent, asking: 'What planet is he from?' \"But it was not possible. Unfortunately, he had serious problems with alcohol. If not, he could be among us celebrating the reunion with his companions from '58.\" In 1977, a Swedish newspaper reported that Garrincha wanted to meet his son. It was agreed that it would happen in the following year, when Ulf was expected to travel to Argentina, during the 1978 World Cup, where Garrincha was due to work as a commentator. \"But the trip did not happen,\" Ulf said. \"My father used to drink a lot and unfortunately was not well.\" Garrincha died on January 20, 1983. Ulf has been to Brazil three times and, during one trip for a TV documentary, discovered he would never know his mother either - she had died months earlier. Garrincha had ten"

      "text": "It comes after 17 schools in Edinburgh were closed earlier this year due to safety concerns. The BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to councils across the country asking what, if any, structural faults had been found at schools in their areas in the last five years. So what schools have been affected and when? In 2010, defects were discovered at St Ninian's in East Renfrewshire. Engineers found wall ties were not properly embedded because the joints in the walls were not aligned. Photographs obtained using Freedom of Information legislation showed metal ties dangling mid-air rather than linking the exterior and interior walls. East Renfrewshire Council paid more than \u00a3870,000 to carry out the necessary repairs. The local authority said it did not inform parents of the issue because \"at no time was there a health and safety risk to pupils, staff or visitors\". It said the matter was discussed \"openly\" at a full council meeting in May 2013. In January 2012, problems were identified at two schools in South Lanarkshire. In stormy weather, during the Christmas holidays, walls collapsed at both Trinity High School in Rutherglen and Duncanrig High School in East Kilbride. Repair work was overseen by Morgan Sindall, the company which runs the schools. It then looked at all 16 schools it has responsibility for in South Lanarkshire and found a small number of wall and header ties needed replaced at an additional eight schools: After the problems with schools in Edinburgh were identified earlier this year it emerged that a similar structural fault had been found at Lourdes Primary in Glasgow in November 2012. Engineers found header ties missing. The building firm involved, Miller Construction, was also involved in the Edinburgh school crisis. Lourdes Primary was temporarily closed with pupils moved to other schools. Glasgow City Council said the issue was handled quickly and effectively, with Miller Construction accepting all responsibility and covering the cost of the repair work. Structural surveys were subsequently carried out on all Glasgow schools built by Miller Construction and came back clear. In May this year, Balfron High School in Stirlingshire was partially closed after structural problems were identified. A wall at the school had been damaged during winter storms and after checks were carried out by engineers issues with walls in the stairwell, gym and atrium were discovered. Again, the problems centred on wall and header tie defects. Initial repair work was carried out before the holidays with further work due to be completed ahead of pupils returning after the summer break. The problems with schools in Edinburgh came to light earlier this year during inspections carried out following a wall collapse at Oxgangs Primary School. Other schools affected included: Repairs have now been completed at all the Edinburgh schools, with pupils due to return to their classrooms this week. The council has assured parents all the buildings affected by the closures are now safe. BBC Scotland Investigates: How Safe is My School? On BBC1 Scotland at 19:00 on Monday 22 August."

They were eventually all out for 230, losing their last four wickets for 30. England Test captain Alastair Cook closed on 43, with Tom Westley 58 not out, as Essex reached stumps on 111-1. Masters' seven-wicket haul added up to the second-best bowling figures of his career, bettered only by his 8-10 against Leicestershire at Southend in 2011. Essex fast bowler David Masters told BBC Radio Essex: \"I'm getting a bit older now and can't play as many games, so when I am playing I'm generally fresh. They've looked after me well this year. I've played when they've needed me to play and hopefully I don't disappoint. \"My body takes a bit more of a battering now and it takes me a bit more time to recover. But I still love playing, I love bowling. \"It's quite a docile wicket actually. The shine came off the new-ball and it started to swing and I got the ball in the right areas. That can happen sometimes.\" Worcestershire assistant coach Matt Mason told BBC Hereford & Worcester: \"We probably lacked a bit of application with the bat, particularly early on with some soft dismissals in there. And that last session was probably the poorest we have had as a bowling unit this year, so not an ideal day. \"When you win the toss and bat first you want to post 400, let's be honest. It looked a good surface and if we'd applied ourselves better you could bat and get some good partnerships. \"I wouldn't want to detract anything from Masters' spell. He did what he's done for his whole career - he put the ball on the spot and nagged away. He is very disciplined, but I don't think we were very good in defence.\""

The man, sporting a side parting and a trademark moustache, had been seen having his photograph taken outside the house in Braunau am Inn in which Adolf Hitler was born. The lookalike had recently moved to the town on the German border, police spokesman David Furtner told the BBC. Mr Furtner said this was not a joke or a piece of performance art. \"The young man knows exactly what he is doing,\" the police spokesman said. He said the man had also been spotted in Vienna and Graz. Pictures of the man were published by Austria's Heute.at news website on Monday. Glorifying the Nazi era is a crime in Austria. Last October, the Austrian authorities decided to demolish Hitler's birthplace house to stop it becoming a focal point for neo-Nazis. Hitler was born in a rented room on the top floor of the building on 20 April 1889. During Nazi rule, the house was transformed into a shrine to Hitler as the town drew in a wave of tourists. But as the Nazis began to lose control in 1944, it was shut."

New arrivals then had to sleep in the living room of their flat on the south-eastern fringes of Paris. \"We used to tell each other stories at night,\" the 40-year-old recalls. \"I've always liked living in a housing estate because we're on top of each other. Mixing and sharing are part of life there.\" Mokobe, who has filled venues from Chad to California over a two-decade career, believes his banlieue roots have given him an edge as a performer. This picture belies the image of the ethnic hinterland of French cities as ghettos. The country often stands accused of failing to integrate migrants, leaving them to fester in crime-ridden poverty. Marginalisation is often blamed for regular waves of rioting and for the rise of home-grown jihadists, such as those who struck Paris last year and Nice in July. After the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January 2015, the French prime minister denounced \"geographic, social and ethnic apartheid\". But, wretched as they undoubtedly are, the banlieues are in reality hotbeds of upward mobility. Mokobe sees bright side of suburbs Entertainers like Mokobe and sports stars are not the only people to arise from the banlieue and thrive. Most of the rapper's childhood friends, he says, have moved on to have successful careers. Research shows that far from being ghettos, \"Sensitive Urban Zones\" in official parlance (ZUS) - are the parts of France that have the highest population turnover. Two-thirds of those who lived there 10 years ago have left and been replaced by newcomers, typically other migrant families, says Christophe Guilluy, a geographer. It is true that the ZUS score poorly on every economic indicator. Unemployment there is two to three times the national figure. Crime is rampant. But this disturbing social picture is not inconsistent with individual success. \"The jobless banlieue-dwellers of today are not the same as yesterday's and will not be the same tomorrow,\" as Mr Guilluy puts it. For most residents, ZUS are transit zones. If they were traps, they would be full of pensioners. \"Outside the tower blocks you would see men playing cards, just like in villages,\" Mr Guilluy says. But what first strikes you in any banlieue is how young people are. Those people who rioted in 1990 are now pushing 50 and have moved on. \"It is not them who throw stones at police cars today,\" Mr Guilluy says. \"This shows the very real economic integration of people who have left the banlieues.\" Moussa Camara has worked to channel the youthful energy of immigrant areas for almost a decade. In 2007, as a budding entrepreneur from a rough estate in Cergy-Pontoise, west of Paris, he decided to take action after police shot and wounded a local boy while chasing joy riders. Memories of nationwide banlieue riots 18 months earlier were still fresh and tensions high. Mr Camara convinced people that lobbying was the most effective form of protest and got them"

Solomons previously adapted E Nesbit's Five Children and It for the 2004 film. Eddie Izzard and Kenneth Branagh both appeared in the big screen version.

Waterstones children's buyer Florentyna Martin said: \"My Brother is a Superhero is that rare thing - a hugely funny book for young readers that is also rip-roaringly exciting. \"It is infused with the spirit of larger than life heroes and colourful comic book trivia that enthrals younger readers and delights superhero fans of all ages, yet at its heart is a touching relationship between siblings. \"Given the author's background it's no surprise it is hugely cinematic, but it is also full of wonderful writing and so brilliantly plotted that one never knows what to expect next.\" The book chain's managing director James Daunt added: \"The quality of the books on the shortlists this year was exceptional, reflecting the vibrant health of the children's book market. \"That our winners were all first books, and each from a flourishing independent publisher, reflects how blessed we are currently by the breadth of creative talent in this country.\" Litchfield's book is about a bear who teaches himself to play the piano, while Williamson's is focused on LGBT issues and tells the story of two teenagers and their struggle with identity."

      "text": "The Electoral Commission said the wording proposed by ministers - \"should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?\" - could be perceived as biased to the status quo. It has proposed adding the words \"or leave the European Union?\" The government has said it will accept the changes although the final decision will be made by Parliament. However, the development has been welcomed by those campaigning to exit the EU. The vote on the UK's membership of the European Union is due to take place before the end of 2017. If the changes were made the options for voters in the referendum would be \"Remain a member of the European Union\" or \"Leave the European Union\" rather than the Yes/No options in the existing wording. The watchdog said it was recommending the rethink after consulting members of the public, campaigners and academics. While in its current form, the question was \"easy for people to understand and answer\", the watchdog said that by only setting out the \"remain\" option and the \"yes\" response, it could \"encourage voters to consider one response more favourably than the other\" - that option being the status quo. This, it warned, could potentially raise issues about the legitimacy of the eventual result, particularly in the eyes of those campaigning to leave the EU. The amended question, it argued, \"would not cause comparable concerns about neutrality, whilst also being easily understood\". \"Any referendum question must be as clear as possible so that voters understand the important choice they are being asked to make,\" said its chair Jenny Watson. \"We have tested the proposed question with voters and received views from potential campaigners, academics and plain language experts.\" \"Whilst voters understood the question in the Bill some campaigners and members of the public feel the wording is not balanced and there was a perception of bias. \"The alternative question we have recommended addresses this. It is now for Parliament to discuss our advice and decide which question wording should be used.\" Ms Watson said it was standard practice for the watchdog to recommend changes to referendum questions and it showed the process was working normally. MPs will consider the issue when they return from their summer recess next week as part of legislation paving the way for the vote. But ministers said they would table changes to the EU Referendum Bill to enact the new wording. \"The prime minister's objective has always been clear - to give people a very clear and simple choice,\" a No 10 spokeswoman said. \"We believe that will still be achieved with the recommendation from the Electoral Commission today.\" UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the change was welcome, tweeting: \"I'm in no doubt that the Yes/No offering was leading to great confusion and that Remain or Leave is much clearer. That, combined with a more explicit question, is the right direction of travel.\" Should the wording be changed, it will cast doubt on the approach of the embryonic Yes and No campaigns.

It is a good competition, only over a short period of time, so the games are thick and fast with lots of travelling - that is one of the things I found quite difficult, the travelling side of it. \"But I could not speak highly enough of the league. Everybody out there is superb. They try to be as professional as possible. They have got a lot of experience and big names out there and they are trying to build up grass-roots level and start from the bottom.\" Pearson also believes the lure of lucrative contracts in India will encourage other players to try their luck over in the sub-continent.

You're allowed 15 foreign players, and 15 local players. But you can only have five foreign players in the starting team at one time - I think they might be reducing that to encourage the progression of the Indian lads.\" However, Pearson says Indian football still cannot compete with the money being splashed by clubs in China. \"I think the money that is getting thrown around in China is just on another level at the minute,\" he said. \"In India they do try to pay the foreign players well because it is only a short time that they are out there and they want to get the best players to come and help the Indian players develop. \"They are passionate about it and everything they do, they give it their all.\" In terms of his ambitions with Motherwell for the rest of the Premiership season, Pearson added: \"I am just looking forward to helping the team out, contribute as much as I can between now and the end of the"

IS militants captured the ancient city of Palmyra last May. Since then it has blown up monumental temples, arches and statues in the Unesco World Heritage site, bringing global condemnation. Meanwhile, IS claimed on Friday it had killed five Russian soldiers in fighting around Palmyra in recent days. Russia has not commented on the claim and there is no independent verification. In recent months, IS has been losing ground to President Bashar al-Assad's forces, rebel groups, and Kurdish militia fighters. Gen Rudskoi told reporters in Moscow that the Syrian army had also seized key hilltop areas near the city of Aleppo and cut supply routes leading to the IS-held city. US Central Command spokesman Patrick Ryder said there had been some bombardments in the Palmyra region but that they were thought to be made by Russian artillery. Russia had withdrawn most if not all of its strike aircraft and there had been little movement of its ground forces, Col Ryder said. Indirect peace talks aimed at resolving the Syrian conflict have been taking place in Geneva for the past week, but so far shown no progress."

Addresses in Birmingham and London have also been searched. Dyfed-Powys Police said the search in Carmarthenshire concluded on Thursday. A force spokeswoman said: \"The Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit, supported by officers of Dyfed-Powys Police, have today provided assistance to The Metropolitan Police, following yesterday's incident in London. \"In doing this, they have conducted a search of one property in Carmarthenshire - this search has concluded. \"The occupants are receiving appropriate support.

On Thursday evening, the Met confirmed a 75-year-old man was the fifth person to die in the wake of the attack. The force said eight arrests have been made in the capital and in Birmingham - three women and five men - with searches at addresses in Brighton and south east London having now concluded. Earlier, police formally identified the man believed to have been responsible for the Westminster attack as Masood, a 52-year-old from Kent who was born Adrian Elms and who was thought to have most recently been living in the West Midlands. Police said Masood was not the subject of any existing investigations and there was \"no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack\". However, he was known to police and had a range of previous convictions for assaults, including causing grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. South Wales Police and Gwent Police said they were reviewing their respective security arrangements in light of the incident and there would be an increase in police presence in busy areas. North Wales Police has asked people to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious. The Islamic State group has said it was behind the attack.

He again showed a clam temperament to hold the innings together with one six and 15 fours after Rory Burns (17) was lbw to Ball in only the second over of the day. Sangakkara also looked in good touch before he and Steven Davies departed in similar fashion in the same Ball over. Jason Roy made a typically assertive 37, but was then lbw to Brett Hutton, leaving Harinath to bring up his century with a sweep for three off Samit Patel."

Jail officials, it said, had failed to address a \"dramatic increase\" in suicides over the past two years. But the sheriff's office said it was \"disappointed\" the report \"fails to fully recognise\" improvements made. \"The report also mischaracterises and significantly understates the incredible efforts made to improve our suicide prevention practices,\" the sheriff's office said in statement. The US justice department said the nation's largest jail system - with about 19,000 prisoners - had completed some of the reforms required by a 2002 court agreement. It also applauded steps to expand community supervision programmes, saying a rapid increase in the number of prisoners who are seriously mentally ill was putting the system under strain. But it said \"serious systemic deficiencies\" and \"deplorable environmental conditions\" remained for those being held at the jail, violating the US constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Among the criticisms in the report was a lack of response to an increase in suicides and suicide attempts at county jails. \"Fifteen suicides in 25 months produced almost no discernible change in the jails' custodial practices,\" the report said. Other findings include: The sheriff's office said it remains committed to working with the Justice Department on the issues. Jails in the US are generally for people being locked up in the short-term, but the prison system throughout the state of California, where inmates serve longer sentences, has also come under scrutiny for overcrowding."

      "text": "In one test, nearly half the subjects gave themselves mild electric shocks during 15 minutes of quiet time. The findings, which came from shutting people away with no distractions and then quizzing them, have attracted criticism from some other researchers. The contentious paper, in the journal Science, argues we are not very good at enjoyable, recreational thought. Prof Timothy Wilson, who led the research at the University of Virginia, US, said: \"Our study participants consistently demonstrated that they would rather have something to do than to have nothing other than their thoughts for even a fairly brief period of time.\" This might not be a surprise if you are easily bored, or have ever picked at a painful scab in a quiet moment. In fact, other researchers in the field have said the findings are overstated. But the authors write that the question of whether people enjoy \"just thinking\" has been overlooked in psychological research. Their work began with several trials involving university students, who were shut in a small room with blank walls and asked to sit at a table \"entertaining themselves with their own thoughts\". After six, 12 or 15 minutes, they were asked whether the time was enjoyable and whether it was difficult to concentrate. On average, their answers were near the middle of a nine-point scale or worse. To show that this was not a problem arising from the poky laboratory room, or a character flaw unique to flighty students, other experiments required a wider pool of volunteers, aged up to 77, to complete a similar test at home, sitting at a computer. Unpoliced in their own homes, many of them \"cheated\" by checking their phones or listening to music. A control group was asked to find an external distraction, alone, like watching TV or browsing the internet, and they had a much better time than those left to try to daydream. Finally, Prof Wilson's team did the electric shock experiment to try to find out if quiet, solo thinking was unpleasant enough that people would actually prefer something nasty to happen. Sure enough, 18 of 42 people, more of them men than women, chose to give themselves at least one mild shock on the ankle when left alone for 15 minutes. \"It was kind of like a severe static shock, it was not a huge jolt, but it was a little painful,\" Prof Wilson told the BBC's Naked Scientists programme. \"They seem to want to shock themselves out of boredom, so to speak.\" These were all people who had experienced the same shock already and declared that, if given $5, they would part with some of it in order not to be zapped again. People who didn't think they'd pay to avoid the shock were excluded - as was one man who pushed the button 190 times. \"I'm not sure what was up with him,\" Prof Wilson said. Some UK researchers have questioned aspects of the study, including the level of shock delivered, which was higher for men than women (based on early results in which women"

The Bank of Scotland PMI survey showed companies added to their payrolls for the third successive month. That was despite firms facing the sharpest increase in input costs since September 2011. A further rise in output charges was reported, although the rate of inflation was weaker than that for input costs. Seasonally-adjusted figures showed Scotland's private sector grew for a second successive month. The increase in output was spread across manufacturers and service providers, with both reporting \"marginal growth\" in business activity levels. The PMI panel members said companies' cost prices increased at the sharpest rate for more than five years as a consequence of a drop in the strength of the pound. Nick Laird, the regional managing director of Bank of Scotland Commercial Banking, said: \"Output for Scottish private sector companies continued to show growth in October, albeit at a reduced rate weighed down by a combination of higher input prices and stagnating new business. \"The increasing cost burden is a cause for concern, with the rise in input costs growing at the quickest rate in just over five years attributed to the depreciation of Sterling. \"Encouragingly, workforce numbers rose for a third consecutive month. Yet with a further solid decline in backlogs of work recorded, we could see jobs growth come under pressure towards the end of the year.\""

His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with \"deafening eclat\" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image. Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day. He said that he had come to"

He had been born with a real talent and everyone in his family and his community knew that he was really good at football.\" The teenage boy described by outreach worker Antonio Carlos da Silva could be any of Brazil's football-mad youngsters. But Rodrigo Kelton had not just stood out in training sessions. At only 14, he had already overcome great odds to make it to that age alive. Rodrigo was one of the thousands of children born into hardship in the north-eastern state of Ceara, where according to official figures more than 133,000 people live on less than 70 reais ($30; \u00c2\u00a318.50) a month. Born into deep poverty and drug addiction, Rodrigo was driven by severe social problems into a perilous existence on the streets of the state capital, Fortaleza. But according to Mr Silva, the outreach worker who first met Rodrigo living on the streets and persuaded him to move into a shelter in 2009, he was on the brink of turning his life around. \"He was hoping to turn professional, so that he could help his mother get treatment for her drug addiction and buy her a house,\" Mr Silva recalls. Part of what helped him was being part of the Brazilian team competing in the Street Child World Cup, a global tournament that puts the spotlight on issues affecting street children. The tournament currently under way in Rio is the second such event to be held uniting teams of street children from 19 countries, four years after the inaugural competition in Durban. Bernardo Rosemeyer is the founder of O Pequeno Nazareno, a non-governmental organisation which runs the shelter into which Rodrigo moved aged nine. He says the prospect of competing in the Street Child World Cup instilled discipline in Rodrigo's life. \"He had stopped taking drugs and was going to school as part of the conditions to play in the tournament,\" Mr Rosemeyer explains. \"Being in the team was a light in his life. He was even getting on better with his mother who came to all the training sessions.\" But what happened to Team Brazil's best striker shortly before he was due to take part in the Cup reflects the bitter reality of children at the bottom of Brazil's society. In February, Rodrigo decided to move back to the favela, or shanty town, where his family lived. He liked a girl there and dismissed warnings by social workers about the risks of returning to the dangerous neighbourhood. As he left his home on the day of his 14th birthday with his older brother Raphael, the brothers were shot at by members of a drug gang in retaliation for an alleged robbery several years before. Rodrigo was killed and Raphael only survived because the gun had jammed. The news hit his team mates hard. \"I told the players about his death when we all met up to take the bus to the training session,\" recalls Mr Silva. \"At first, they did not believe me and thought I was"

MAC is a cult brand, and it is not uncommon for well-hyped celebrity make-up ranges to sell out online within a day - but for that to happen when the pop icon has been dead for two decades is a striking testimony to her legacy. Those unfamiliar with Tejano (Mexican-American) music may never have heard of Selena, who was just hitting the US mainstream when she was murdered. But for many Latina women, she is an inspiration - the first Tejano singer to debut at the top of the Billboard chart when her posthumous crossover album, Dreaming of You, was released in 1996. In 1990, her second album, Ven Conmigo (\"Come With Me\"), was the first Tejano record to achieve gold status, meaning it sold more than 500,000 copies. And in 1993, the album Live! won her a Grammy Award for Best Mexican/American Album. Her story was brought to life in the 1997 film Selena, which gave Jennifer Lopez her break-out acting role. It depicts the flamboyant singer's rise from 10-year-old star of her family's band, Selena y Los Dinos, and how she learned Spanish to connect with the Latino community. Though her father was not keen to include the scene where 20-year-old Selena eloped with her lead guitarist Chris Perez and married him the same day, he was talked into keeping it to reflect their love story honestly. While the film focuses on her life, it includes how she was lured to a motel and shot dead by Yolanda Saldivar, the former president of her fan club, when the Quintanilla family found evidence Saldivar had embezzled $60,000 from Selena's fan club and boutiques. The film became the 11th highest-grossing musical biopic of all time, taking $35,281,794, enabling Jennifer Lopez to become the new highest-paid Latina actress, netting a million dollars. Determined to do the role justice, Lopez moved in with the Quintanilla family to understand Selena's life better. A stadium scene depicting Selena's final concert featured an astonishing 35,000 extras - many of whom were fans. As of 2012, Selena had sold over 60 million albums worldwide. Her ongoing relevance was underlined in July, when the Hollywood Hall of Fame confirmed she would get her own star in 2017. Eva Longoria, the Latina actress who became a household name with the TV show Desperate Housewives, was nominated at the same time. Writing on Instagram, she said she was especially overjoyed to share the honour with Selena. \"The same year I receive my star, so does my idol, my inspiration, my fellow Tejana, my fellow Corpus Christi native, Selena Quintanilla. She was the reason I even dared to dream that a better life was possible,\" Eva wrote. \"She blazed the way for all of us and I will be forever grateful to her for not only that but for the pure joy I"

But she added it was \"important to ask whether the BBC can do more in its popular output to provide an authentic portrayal of life in modern Britain\". The population of EastEnders was also younger than in real life, she said. Ms Coyle is in the running to be head of the BBC Trust after Lord Patten stepped down due to ill health. The BBC's audience council in England compared the population of Walthamstow in east London with Walford, the fictional home of EastEnders. The figures suggested there were nearly twice as many white people living in Walford - E20 - as in real life E17, while the population of EastEnders tends to be younger than their real-life counterparts and more likely to have been born in the UK. It is not the first time that Black, Asian and minority ethnic representation (BAME) in EastEnders has been called into question. The soap's former boss, John Yorke, said EastEnders \"may be significantly white compared with the real East End\" back in May 2011. At the time, he added that it was \"considerably more multicultural than it was even five years ago and is easily the most multicultural show on telly now\". The BBC responded to Ms Coyle's comments by saying: \"We agree with the trust that EastEnders has one of the most diverse casts on British television and that it would be daft to suggest that the programme needs to be a perfect replica of a particular postcode. \"As announced by [director general] Tony Hall last week, the BBC has plans to lead the industry on diversity, both on and off screen.\" Ms Coyle also asked for improvements in BBC One's output across the board. Speaking at the London School of Economics, she said that according to BBC research, BBC One, the home of EastEnders, \"plays it too safe in parts of its peak-time schedule\". \"BBC One is greatly appreciated. But it can sometimes feel too predictable. Its viewers expect still more from it,\" she added. The BBC said that the channel reaches 76% of the population, or 44 million people each week. \"These audiences are clearly finding a huge amount that informs, educates and entertains them,\" it said. \"We continually strive to deliver new and original programmes and it has been our consistent ability to do this over the years which has made BBC One Britain's most-watched and loved channel.\" The BBC Trust will set out in more detail what it would like the corporation to do next month. Ms Coyle also said it was a priority for the BBC to increase the number of women on air. Her comments follow the BBC's announcement last week to have greater BAME representation on and off air. The BBC will put \u00c2\u00a32.1m into a fund intended to help BAME talent, on and off screen, to develop new programmes. BBC targets call for about one in six people (15%) on-air to be from BAME backgrounds within"

Benali, 47, described receiving the honour as \"a complete surprise\". \"It's just wonderful to be thought of,\" he added. The honour was awarded in recognition of Benali's fund raising achievements for charitable causes, as well those as a player and coach at Saints, the authority said. It confers no rights or privileges, such as driving sheep through the city, and is \"purely ceremonial\", it added. The 1,000-mile (1,600km) route linking 44 football clubs took him to south Wales, the Midlands and the North-West, before crossing the country and returning via East Anglia and London. He raised more than \u00c2\u00a3390,000 for Cancer Research. Benali received a standing ovation from fans when he arrived at St Mary's Stadium at half-time during a home match against Burnley on 16 October. It followed another challenge in 2014 which saw him running between 20 Premier League stadiums and raising more than \u00c2\u00a3265,000 for charity. As a result he was presented with the Barclays Spirit of the Game award in December 2014, acknowledged as the Cancer Research UK Flame of Hope Award Winner 2015, Fundraising Volunteer of the Year and also the Just Giving Celebrity Fundraiser of the Year 2015.

He joined a number of Hindus in urging the notes be banned from temples, where meat products are forbidden. A petition to ban the new \u00a35 notes has attracted more than 100,000 signatures. It calls on the Bank of England to \"cease to use animal products in the production of currency that we have to use\". Hosted on the Change.org website, it states that tallow is \"unacceptable to millions of vegans, vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others in the UK\". The Bank of England began issuing the polymer notes in September pledging they \"last longer, stay cleaner and are harder to counterfeit than paper notes\". Its only response so far to the petition has been in a statement to \"confirm that the polymer pellet from which the base substrate is made contains a trace of a substance known as tallow\". Critics say there are plant-based substitutes that could be used in its place. The response from the UK's Hindu and Sikh communities began to gather pace after vegans and vegetarians voiced their feelings on social media on Tuesday. Hindus believe cows are holy and sacred, and many do not wear shoes or carry bags made from the skin of cattle that has been slaughtered. Practising Sikhs are strict vegetarians. Speaking to the BBC's Asian Network, Coventry-based Mr Singh said: \"Every time I come across a \u00a35 note I'll be reminded that it contains meat by-product.\" He said no animal by-product should breach the sanctity of a gurdwara [Sikh temple]. Gauri Das, managing director at the Bhaktivedanta Manor Hindu temple in Watford, is calling for the notes to be banned from his site immediately. \"Our temples prosper on the charity of all of our members,\" he said. \"Our ethos is not to harm animals. It's problematic for us because we're implicated in the process. So it's immediately become a matter of concern for our community.\" Meanwhile, the president of one of the largest Hindu temples in Leicester has urged worshippers not to give charitable donations with the new \u00a35. Vibhooti Acharya, from the Shree Sanatan Mandir temple, said it was a \"matter of choice\" but it would be putting up notices to make the community aware of the situation. She added: \"There needs to be a decision made between committee as to whether we accept \u00a35 notes in religious ceremonies in future.\""

The former spy cannot be identified because of fears about his safety. Mr Donaldson was shot dead months after admitting that he had been an MI5 agent for more than 20 years. Three years later, the Real IRA said it was responsible. On Wednesday, Mr Adams said he \"specifically and categorically\" denied the allegations, describing them as \"part of the British security agencies ongoing attempts to smear republicans and cover up their own actions\". He said he would consider taking legal action against the BBC. \"I've taken a number of cases against various periodicals, I got a number of corrections and apologies from a number of outlets,\" said Mr Adams. \"If my legal advisers give me the type of guidance that I require, I will sue them. I'm not reluctant to sue. \"That the BBC would broadcast unsubstantiated allegations from an anonymous person, a self-confessed agent, about me, I think it's very, very low journalism indeed.\" Mr Adams said there was a need for all agencies to \"fully co-operate with the ombudsman's investigation into the role of the police in the events that led to the killing of Denis Donaldson and for the Garda\u00ed to expedite their investigation to bring those responsible to justice.\" The Sinn F\u00e9in leader said he would \"continue to support the family of Mr Donaldson to achieve truth and justice\". Mr Donaldson had worked for Sinn F\u00e9in as a senior administrator at Stormont. He was killed at a remote Donegal cottage in 2006. What Spotlight was told Agent: I know from my experience in the IRA that murders have to be approved by the leadership. They have to be given approval by the leadership of the IRA and the military leadership of the IRA. Presenter: Who are you specifically referring to? Agent: Gerry Adams, he gives the final say. The informer told Spotlight that murders had to be approved by the political and military leadership of the IRA. Days after Mr Donaldson's killing, the IRA said it was not involved in Mr Donaldson's death. But security sources have told Spotlight that intelligence received following the killing contradicted the IRA's denial. You can watch BBC Spotlight: Spy in the IRA now on BBC iPlayer."

TTIP was however addressed in the manifestos. War on Want (who oppose the plans) have compiled the parties' positions on the issue. Outside the political arena there are some very strong opinions. Many business voices are enthusiastic, but there is also very vocal opposition. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or it will be if the negotiations are completed. The aim is to boost the economies of the EU and the US by removing or reducing barriers to trade and foreign investment. President Obama said, when the talks were launched, that TTIP would promote \"new growth and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic\". Critics reject that claim - more of that below. A study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) - done for the European Commission - estimated the potential gains for the EU as up to \u20ac119bn (\u00a385bn; $134bn) a year and \u20ac95bn (\u00a368bn; $107bn) for the US. For a family of four that comes to \u20ac545 per year in the EU and \u20ac655 in the US. Wages would be higher, by 0.5% in the EU and just under 0.4% in the US. The CEPR has done a more specific estimate of the benefits for the UK, which suggested gains in annual national income of up to \u00a310bn. By eliminating almost all tariffs (taxes applied only to imported goods) on trade between the US and the EU. But the tariffs imposed by the US and EU are already relatively low for the most part, although there are some exceptions in, for example, farm produce and textiles. The bigger gains envisaged would come from reducing what are called non-tariff barriers. In particular the two sides think they can promote trade through what they call regulatory co-operation. This is about costs to business. Complying with regulations involves a cost. A firm that wants to export may incur further costs meeting the regulatory requirements of the country it's selling into. The European Commission says that rules in Europe and the US often achieve the same level of consumer safety and product quality, but differ in their technical details and their methods for ensuring that firms have met the rules. One of the aims of TTIP is to reduce this burden on business. One option is recognising one another's standards. That's under consideration for many types of goods. They also plan to co-operate more closely on new regulation. That basic idea is that by reducing the cost of exporting, TTIP would encourage more of it. The idea here is to encourage transatlantic foreign investment. The European Commission says an agreement in this area would prohibit discrimination against foreign investors, expropriation, denying access to the courts and arbitrary and abusive treatment. If a foreign investor felt these rules had been violated, they would have access to a system known as investor state dispute settlement, or ISDS. This is a system of tribunals that could award compensation"

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem. Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government. Reports said that the BJP's youth wing lodged a complaint against a Facebook post by Mr Chavara which allegedly insulted the anthem. The post was apparently an excerpt from one of his books. Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist \"is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook\" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played. The cinemagoers, who were attending an international film festival, were later freed but they face charges of \"failure to obey an order issued by a public servant, thereby causing obstruction or annoyance to others\". And at a cinema in Chennai, eight people who did not stand for the anthem were assaulted and abused, police said. The eight were later charged with showing disrespect to the anthem."

The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. \"We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,\" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. \"Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet \"No-drama Obama\" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted \"If you're covered and you know it clap your hands.\" \"This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,\" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. \"The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land\". \"Today is a good day for healthcare in America,\" said activist Benton Strong. \"I hope this is the end of the line.\" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. \"We should start calling this law Scotuscare\" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. \"Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard"

While Sneyd was key with his kicking and prompting in the win against the Warriors, he highlighted the impact made by the forwards such as Liam Watts, Gareth Ellis and Scott Taylor, as well as the all-round defensive effort. Wigan threatened a late comeback victory, but Hull did enough to repel their threat. \"We've got a bit of everything in every department,\" Sneyd, 26, continued. \"It's an unbelievable group to be playing in. We were clinging on at the end, and we've got people who are willing to work hard for one another.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Securing the Lance Todd Trophy for a second time ensured Sneyd added his name to an exalted list of just six players who have twice been named man of the match in a Challenge Cup final. Warrington's Gerry Helme (1950 and 1954) was the first, before Wigan pair Andy Gregory and Martin Offiah both did it twice during the club's glorious eight-year reign as Wembley winners in the late 1980s and early 1990s. St Helens legend Sean Long went on to win it three times, while his Saints team-mate Paul Wellens did it back-to-back in 2007 and 2008, the first of those being shared with Leon Pryce. But Sneyd is the first to achieve the award, which is voted for members of the Rugby League Writers Association, outright in successive years. \"Leon Pryce was actually the one who told me no-one had won it twice outright before,\" said Sneyd, who is in his third season with Hull. \"It's unbelievable when you see the names that are on the trophy. You can't quite believe that your name is on there. To be there twice - I'm over the moon with that.\" Hull coach Lee Radford said Sneyd's personal achievement was \"a phenomenal effort from a phenomenal player\". \"Look at the impact he's had on our club since he walked through the door,\" continued Radford, who also said he believes Sneyd is the \"most criticised half-back\" that the club has ever had. Former Castleford and Salford player Sneyd has previously spoken about online abuse he receives on social media following matches. \"I genuinely quite enjoy going home and seeing what they say about me on Twitter,\" said Sneyd. \"It really doesn't bother me. \"You give them a little favourite and you imagine what they're like at home, while I'm there laughing my head off.\" Wigan head coach Shaun Wane praised Hull after the match, saying they deserved their 18-14 victory at Wembley.

The committee has investigated working practices at Shirebrook, and wanted to see if improvements had been made. After a three hour tour, they gathered in a private room when they said a recording device was found. The company had been expecting a visit from MPs, but was not told when the spot check would be. One of the six, Anna Turley, MP for Redcar, said: \"At the end of the meeting, we sat down to have a private conversation in a room by ourselves. \"A lady came in with some sandwiches, which was very kind. I saw her take too long to do it, she put it down and I saw her put a recording device on the floor. \"She left the room and I went over to pick up the device and there it was: a camera and a recording device for the conversation that we were having privately. \"I'm very disappointed.\" A spokesman for Sports Direct declined to comment. The committee chairman, Iain Wright said he spoke to Sports Direct's chief executive, Mike Ashley, on the phone after the MPs left the warehouse. He said: \"I don't think it was a particularly pleasant conversation for either of us. \"I want to work with Mike Ashley in a constructive manner. I don't think he wants to work with us at all any more.\" The company, which has around 450 retail outlets, came under the spotlight after a BBC investigation uncovered a culture of unorthodox and illegal working practices at the warehouse. Among issued raised were staff being kept on site at Shirebrook after their shifts for body searches, putting them below the legal minimum wage. Concern about working conditions led to Sports Direct's founder Mike Ashley being called to appear in front of the Business and Skills Committee. He admitted at the hearing that control of the company had slipped beyond him. Mr Ashley denied knowing about the day-to-day operation at Shirebrook. Sports Direct has promised a number of changes since Mr Ashley's appearance at the committee. Mr Ashley is thought to be on holiday and was not at Shirebrook during the visit."

Calls have been made by Opposition MSPs for the work on the reorganisation to be postponed pending a review of the way calls to police are handled. The review, by HM Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland (HMICS), is due to report in October. The closure of the Aberdeen control room was originally scheduled to be completed the previous month. But a north-east MSP has said the programme, which has already seen control rooms in Dumfries, Stirling and Glenrothes closed, should be halted until the HMICS review is published. It was ordered following the deaths of two people in a car crash on the M9 in Stirlingshire on July 6, and will examine the case for shutting regional control centres. Although the incident was reported to police at the time, officers only attended the scene three days later after a second call from a different person. John Yuill, 28, was found dead and 25-year-old Lamara Bell critically injured. She later died in hospital from injuries including broken bones and kidney damage caused by dehydration. The initial call had been handled by the Bilston Glen call centre which takes calls from Central Scotland and Fife following the closure of Stirling and Glenrothes. Lewis Macdonald, Labour MSP for north-east Scotland said the programme of closures - which has already seen a number of skilled staff leaving Aberdeen - should be halted by police until after HMICS has reported. He said: \"It would be absolutely unacceptable for them to continue with the closure plans while the decision is being looked at and while the future delivery of police control rooms across Scotland is under review. \"So I hope that we will hear from Police Scotland very, very shortly to the effect that they will take no steps leading to the closure of the Aberdeen control room, the service centre which answers 101 calls in Aberdeen or indeed the control room in Inverness. \"Because it is quite clear the local knowledge that is accumulated in these control rooms cannot be replicated, will be lost if they close and will simply heap further pressure on the control rooms in the Central Belt.\" In a statement Assistant Chief Constable Val Thomson, commander of Police Scotland's C3 Division which is developing the control room reorganisation, said: \"We remain committed to the C3 change programme and are in discussion with the Scottish Police Authority (SPA).\" A police spokesman said any decision on closures would have to be ratified by the SPA, which oversees the single police force. It said the original timescale was now unlikely to be adhered to. A spokesperson said: \"Consultation with staff has not started yet. The timeline over the coming months needs to allow both proposals from staff via official consultation and any key findings from the HMICS work to be considered, before any final decisions are made.\""

They include false accounting linked to transactions worth 7bn euros (\u00a35.4bn). He was arrested in the early hours of Monday after arriving at Dublin Airport on an overnight flight from Boston. Garda\u00ed (Irish police) accompanied the former chief executive on the transatlantic flight and shortly after landing he was brought to a Dublin police station, and then escorted to the court. The hearing was told that Mr Drumm made no reply when police officers put the charges to him at the station. Sixteen of the charges relate to the alleged provision of unlawful financial assistance to 16 wealthy investors, in a bid to prop up Anglo's share price before the collapse. Mr Drumm moved to the US in 2009, the same year Anglo Irish Bank had to be bailed out by Irish taxpayers. Police objected to his bail application, claiming the accused is a potential flight risk. A sergeant told the court police believed Mr Drumm had the capacity to flee the jurisdiction and seemed to have access to large sums of money when required, despite owing millions in debts. A prosecution lawyer told the court the accused had fought tooth and nail against his extradition from Boston and had been leading the authorities a \"merry dance\" during the process. However, Mr Drumm's solicitor said his client had offered to surrender his passport, be tagged and sign on twice daily at his local police station. The defence lawyer added that the accused had offered to provide a \"relatively large\" amount of cash and had several family members who were willing to \"put their houses on the line\" so he could be granted bail. The judge granted bail on Mr Drumm's own bond of 50,000 euros (\u00a339,000) and two independent sureties of 50,000 euros. Mr Drumm ran Anglo Irish Bank from 2005 to 2008 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in the US. However, the bankruptcy bid failed and a Boston court ruled that he could be held liable for debts of 10.5m euros (\u00a38.34m). It was alleged during the bankruptcy case that the 48-year-old former bank boss secretly transferred money and assets to his wife, so they could not be seized during bankruptcy proceedings. Authorities in the Republic of Ireland issued an extradition request last year and he was arrested at his American home in October. At a hearing in Boston last month, Mr Drumm agreed to return to the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible. Bailing out the bank cost Irish taxpayers about 30bn euros (\u00a322bn: $34bn), close to one-fifth of annual output. Its downfall played a large role in the collapse of the Irish economy in 2008 and the ensuing bailout from its eurozone partners two years later."

It stressed clubs have been \"working hard on delivery\" since a 2014 BBC report found that 17 of 20 clubs did not provide enough wheelchair spaces. But campaigners have criticised the failure to meet the standards set out. \"The time for excuses is over,\" said David Isaac, chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. \"The Premier League promised that disabled access would be improved by the start of next season, so it is disappointing that a number of clubs will fail to meet that deadline. \"Clubs need to urgently demonstrate to us what they are doing to ensure they are compliant with the law and how they are making it easier for disabled fans to attend matches. If they don't they will face legal action.\" The Premier League's report comes after MPs argued last month that top-flight clubs were prioritising finance over improving access and meeting the Accessible Stadia Guidelines. The Culture, Media and Sport select committee report said clubs should face legal action if they fail to meet the basic needs of disabled fans. The Premier League board can impose fines of up to \u00a325,000, while cases of serious breaches would be referred to an independent panel - which could impose heavier fines or even deduct points. Bournemouth have 195 disabled fan spaces but not to the required standard. However, they do not own their Vitality Stadium home and the club says that the stadium's small size makes meeting guidelines difficult. It is planning to move to a bigger ground in the coming years. Chelsea have 128 spaces for disabled fans, against a recommended 214. The club is aiming to move to a new 60,000-seat stadium and says in the meantime it will consult with disabled fans. Watford have spaces for 61 disabled fans, but should provide 153. It will have more wheelchair spaces by August but says it faces architectural challenges and is aiming to make other improvements to boost the matchday experience of disabled fans. Burnley, Middlesbrough and Hull were given extensions to 2018 to meet the guideline standards as they were only promoted last summer. \"Premier League clubs have embarked on a substantial programme of work and rapid progress has been made. The improvements undertaken are unprecedented in scope, scale and timing by any group of sports grounds or other entertainment venues in the UK. \"Given the differing ages and nature of stadia, some clubs have, and continue to face, significant challenges. For those clubs, cost is not a determining factor. \"They are working through issues relating to planning, how to deal with new stadium development plans, how to best manage fan disruption or, in cases where clubs don't own their own grounds, dealing with third parties. \"Clubs deserve credit for committing to and delivering the extensive work detailed in this interim report. What is also clear is that even more progress will be achieved in creating the appropriate levels of"

But there have also been a string of cases involving Taiwanese defence ministry officials spying for China, our correspondent says. \"The ministry has discussed the matter for some time and published the revised regulations in view of national security,\" said Interior Minister Chen Wei-zen on Wednesday.

They mainly studied at Xiamen University in Fujian Province, China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing and Jinan University in Guangzhou, Focus Taiwan said. Relations between the two sides were frayed earlier this year when protests broke out in Taiwan over a trade deal with China. In March, student protesters occupied the parliament building.

Australia detains all asylum seekers who arrive by boat, holding them in offshore processing camps. Rights groups have criticised conditions on Manus Island, where asylum-seekers are held. In a new report to be tabled to the UN Human Rights Council on Monday, the rapporteur, Juan Mendez, investigated allegations of torture and abuse in more than 60 countries. In Australia, he highlighted some cases where the authorities had failed to provide adequate detention conditions, end the detention of children, or prevent escalating violence and tension at Manus Island. This meant Australia had violated the right of the asylum-seeker to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the report said. The Australian government has rejected the report. When asked about the UN's findings, Mr Abbott told reporters: \"I really think Australians are sick of being lectured to by the United Nations, particularly, given that we have stopped the boats, and by stopping the boats, we have ended the deaths at sea.\" He said hundreds had drowned at sea as the people-smuggling trade flourished under the previous government. Mr Abbott said stopping the flow of people coming to Australia by boat, mostly through Indonesia, was the \"most humanitarian, most decent, the most compassionate thing you can do\". \"We have stopped the boats and I think the UN's representatives would have a lot more credibility if they were to give some credit to the Australian government for what we've been able to achieve in this area,\" Mr Abbott said. When asked about conditions on Manus, Mr Abbott said: \"All of the basic needs of the people on Manus Island are being met ... everyone's needs for food, for clothing, for shelter, for safety are being more than met.\" One of the allegations investigated by Mr Mendez is the intimidation and ill-treatment of two asylum-seekers after they gave statements about violent attacks at Manus. He found their rights were in fact breached. He also found that two government changes to immigration legislation risk violating international laws prohibiting torture. The report found violations in more than 60 other countries including in the US for the 30-year imprisonment of a mentally ill man on death row. It also raises alarm at the proposed deportation of several individuals from the UK to countries that engage in torture. Australia asylum: Why is it controversial?"

Sentencing him at the High Court in Glasgow, Judge Johanna Johnston said he was guilty of a \"cruel, merciless and extremely violent murder\". In August, a jury at the High Court in Paisley found him guilty of murdering Ms Cameron. The court heard the attack happened after Havaleoglu discovered she was in a relationship with another man. The judge told Havaleoglu: \"Leighanne Cameron was much loved and had everything to live for.\" She said Ms Cameron's injuries had been \"catastrophic\". Havaleoglu attacked the mother-of-two shortly after she returned from work. The killer had been spending the day looking after their children before he struck. He then fled to Edinburgh and it is thought that on his way there he got rid of the murder weapon and the clothes he had been wearing. Ms Cameron's body was discovered by her new boyfriend Philip Kilkenny. Mr Kilkenny called police and revealed Havaleoglu had told Leighanne \"she'd never get to love another man\". The court heard the \"reality\" of Ms Cameron's new relationship had come to \"the full attention\" of Havaleoglu shortly before the murder. Ian Duguid, defending, said it came from a conversation the killer had with one of his young children. The QC said this discovery was suggested to be \"the catalyst\" for the fatal attack. Mr Duguid: \"This is an event that pushed him beyond what his previous behaviour had been.\" Havaleoglu had also been accused of assaulting three other women, but he was cleared of those charges at the trial. Det Ch Insp Raymond Brown, of Police Scotland, said: \"Leighanne's death has been absolutely devastating for her family and those close to her. \"Her five-year-old daughter and two-year-old son have been robbed of their loving mum in the most horrific of circumstances. \"Havaleoglu has callously refused to admit responsibility for Leighanne's murder ever since, despite extensive evidence against him.\" He added: \"Unfortunately, nothing can undo his actions that day but hopefully the outcome at court provides some form of comfort and closure to Leighanne's family and friends.\""

Josh Drinkwater scored a drop-goal in the second half before McNally raced the length of the field to score again. Leigh's victory means Widnes Vikings finish bottom of the Super League at the end of the regular season.

Girlhood is the story of a black teenager, Marieme, who lives in the vast banlieues, or suburbs, of Paris. With a dead-end future in front of her, she forms a relationship with a group of other young girls. None of its leads, including Parisienne Karidja Toure who plays Marieme, had ever acted before - a consequence, says director Celine Sciamma, of her not being able to find enough professional black actresses for the roles. \"We were looking for four months,\" she recalls, \"with a casting director and two assistants.

And then we went in to theatre classes and high schools, but we met most of our cast randomly on the street. \"We had to invent a group, with its alchemy and energy. But we also needed girls with wit, who were able to improvise, because some of the scenes required it. \"All the girls are non-professionals, whereas all the boys had already been on screen. That says something about the representation of black women in cinema.\" Toure, 21, was asked to audition as she sat outside a restaurant in Paris's 14th arrondissement. \"At first I thought the casting process was a little strange,\" she admits. \"But there aren't many black actresses in Paris, so they had to do it that way. You know, black teenagers in Paris, boys and girls, don't watch French movies. \"When you watch French films, you don't see many black characters. So we boycott them, and watch American movies instead. \"During the casting there were around 300 girls, who all have dreams about being actresses. But I guess we don't really believe we can do it, because we don't see many others doing it.\" Like Richard Linklater's Oscar-winning Boyhood, Girlhood is a coming-of-age movie. The circumstances, though, are vastly different. Sciamma grew up in the Paris suburbs herself and says she was writing \"from the things I know - that there are people who have such energy, but they are not given a vision of who they should be.\" Told by her teacher to stop studying and get a job, Marieme plays truant with her new group of friends and becomes a gang fighter. Soon, footage of her beating up other girls is filmed and put on to social media. \"It's very true to life,\" says Toure. \"If you know the suburbs, you know you have the same gangs, the same fights - every French teenager can relate to it. \"Even when I read the script, there were similarities to my life. I've been followed in stores by shop security guards who are told to do it just because I am black. \"My own teacher told"

A female and a baby were retrieved on Sunday, and are already back at Symbio Wildlife Park, south of Sydney. Two men have pleaded guilty to charges of dealing with proceeds of crime. Brothers Jesse and Jackson George are not believed to have snatched the monkeys from their enclosure, but they were charged with trying to profit from the theft. Pygmy marmosets - the world's smallest monkey species - command up to A$5,000 (\u00c2\u00a33,000, $3,700) on the black market. Police found the men after a tip-off from the public. A desperate appeal for information had been launched by the zoo, amid fears that the baby marmoset would die within 48 hours if unable to feed from its mother. The four-week-old was found when the Georges' car was pulled over at Appin, southwest of Sydney. The female marmoset was found about 20km (12 miles) away in the Campbelltown area. Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph said the brothers had exchanged marmoset pictures with a third person via mobile phone, along with messages about how much a monkey could sell for. \"Ay, check out my monkey,\" wrote the third person, according to court documents. \"That's mad bro. Wanna sell it bruh?\" Jackson George replied. The baby marmoset is now home and well, said Symbio Wildlife Park, after they reunited it with its mother. \"Mum cradled the baby straight into her arms and bub immediately began to feed,\" the zoo wrote in a statement on Facebook. Police say they are continuing their investigation into the theft. The zoo said the marmoset enclosure is currently closed \"to give the family privacy\"."

One of the three people taken to hospital sustained serious but non life-threatening injuries, police said. The southbound carriageway has been reopened but investigations are continuing. The remaining passengers, who did not require hospital treatment, were taken to Abingdon police station. Passenger Rebecca Crow posted a picture of her injuries on Twitter and wrote: \"I was on the bus, it was insane. Very thankful for no fatalities; just a bust up face!\" The bus was a replacement for the 00:05 First Great Western service from Oxford to Didcot.

Bus ended up part down the embankment. #a34\" He later told BBC News: \"It sort of jumped forward. There were people screaming inside. \"Then you suddenly noticed you're falling out of your seat - everyone was flying everywhere. \"Once that initial shock had passed people were quite calm. \"A lot of people on the bus had been coming back from a gig in Oxford, that's where I'd been, that kept people calm as a few recognised each other.\" In a statement, a First Great Western spokesman said the firm was \"keen\" to offer support to all of the bus passengers and their families. He said initial reports from its own contractor \"suggest the driver followed correct safety procedures\", but added police were investigating. \"We are offering them any assistance we can to understand the full details of the incident,\" he said. The A34 was shut between the Botley and Milton interchanges. It had been due to reopen at 11:00 but was delayed due to difficulties in recovering the vehicles, police said. Officers on site were having problems earlier with drivers ignoring the closure and driving through, according to BBC Radio Oxford travel reporter Sara Dumbell. She said diversions had also led to lengthy traffic delays in the area."

Last week, South Africa barred Mr Anderson from visiting because of his critical remarks about homosexuality. Homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana, as in many African countries. After his visa for South Africa was rejected, Mr Anderson had posted on his Facebook page: \"Thank God we still have a wide open door in Botswana.\" Mr Anderson was taking part in a morning show hosted by GabzFM station together with a local pastor and an LGBT activist. The show's presenter Reginald Richardson told the BBC that Mr Anderson expressed disdain for homosexuals during the show saying that they should be killed. Botswana's private Mmegi newspaper reported that security agents apprehended the pastor after the radio show. \"I am not being arrested. I am leaving Botswana voluntarily,\" Mr Anderson told witnesses at the radio station, Reuters reports. Onkokame Mosweu, a commentator on gay and lesbian affairs, commended the government's action but said that the pastor should not have been allowed into the country. Mr Khama said that the pastor had been put on a visa watch list after he was banned from travelling to South Africa, but the order had not been communicated to all officials manning the country's borders. The preacher had arrived in Botswana late last week and had given a sermon at a local church that he helped set up, Mr Richardson said. Mr Anderson runs the Faithful Word Baptist Church, which says that homosexuality is an abomination punishable by the death penalty. His church is based in the US state of Arizona and describes itself as an \"old-fashioned, independent, fundamental, King James Bible only, soul-winning Baptist church\"."

Mr Kelly said 71% were \"fully supportive\" of repealing the section of the law covering behaviour at football. And he said there was 62% support for scrapping the section covering offensive communications. Mr Kelly said this compared with 24% who indicated they were fully opposed to repealing the football part of the act, and 21% the communications sections. The vast majority of those who responded were individuals, many of whom expressed concerns that the legislation was infringing on freedom of speech and expression and unfairly criminalising fans. Several people appeared to misunderstand the question, and indicated they were \"fully opposed\" to repealing the act before later suggesting they were in favour. Labour said these respondents had subsequently been given an opportunity to clarify their position, with the final figures taking these clarifications into account. Celtic was the only football club to respond, with its response saying that it \"remains supportive\" of the Scottish government's commitment to addressing unacceptable behaviour. But it also said it retained \"significant concerns\" over potential discrimination against football supporters and confusion in applying and enforcing the law. Of the 21 organisations that responded, ten were supporters groups including the Celtic Trust, Club 1872 and Fans Against Criminalisation - all of which were in favour of repeal. Glasgow City Council also indicated it believe the law should be repealed. But LGBT campaign groups Stonewall Scotland and the Equality Network said repealing the act would send a message that prejudiced and threatening behaviour at football is acceptable, with Stonewall calling for a review of the legislation to examine whether improvements could be made. The act, which came into force in 2012, criminalised offensive and threatening behaviour, including sectarian behaviour, related to football matches and any communications containing threats or incitement to religious hatred. The SNP used its majority in the last Scottish Parliament to pass it - but Labour, the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Greens all back its repeal. Mr Kelly said: \"The SNP were arrogant to bulldoze this piece of legislation through Holyrood in the first place. Every other party opposed it. \"Academics, lawyers, football clubs and football fans opposed it, yet the SNP wouldn't listen and used their then majority in the Scottish Parliament to rail-road the Football Act through. \"Having lost that majority, and faced with clear public support for repeal through the consultation process, it would be incredibly arrogant if the SNP do not now think again.\" But a spokeswoman for the Scottish government said the country continues to have a problem with abusive behaviour at football games. She said: \"A hardcore minority is souring the atmosphere for the majority of football supporters and critics of the Act seem to think our only option is just to accept this contempt for fans and players. \"Not one viable alternative to dealing with the unacceptable scenes of violence and abuse we continue to see at matches has been put forward in the entire debate"

Ian Stewart, Kieron Whittle, John Stewart, Alan Lea, Shaun McDonald and Gary McNeill were sentenced to between 12 and 16 years in prison. All pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to conspiracy to commit robbery. Police said the gang wore masks and either used \"brute force\" to force their way into premises or removed roof tiles to allow them to drop down through the ceiling. Most of the raids - which happened in Sefton, St Helens, Wirral, Liverpool, Warrington, Neston, Birkenhead, Bootle, Southport, Hull and Sutton - occurred when staff were either opening or cashing up. The gang members were given the following sentences: Det Insp Mike Dalton of Merseyside Police said: \"This gang enjoyed a criminal lifestyle on the back of the misery of many decent, hard-working people who were simply doing their job when these men burst in and changed their lives forever. \"This gang was completely ruthless in what they did. \"They did not care who they harmed or what damage they caused as long as they got the money.\" He said: \"Innocent members of staff who were petrified at the time have remained too traumatised to return to work. \"A young mum was robbed of the enjoyment that having a young baby brings. \"Another who had a baby long after the robbery feared the stress she still felt could harm her unborn child.\""

The permit does not allow the company to carry out fracking - hydraulic fracturing of the land - to extract any oil or gas. Fracking is subject to a temporary ban in Wales until decision-making powers on the practice are devolved. Natural Resources Wales said it had carried out a \"thorough assessment\" of the company's plans before approving them, with all work including reinstatement of the land to be completed within 12 months. \"It's important that any activity of this kind doesn't harm the environment, and this permit makes it clear what Coastal Oil and Gas Limited will need to do to comply with this,\" a spokesman said. \"Once the work begins, our officers will regulate and monitor the site to ensure it complies with the conditions of the permit, to protect people and the environment.\" The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions. In August, the UK government urged councils in England to speed up the process of approval for fracking projects. However, Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said fracking technology was \"unproven\", and that Welsh Labour ministers preferred to look at renewable energy."

In those days she dreamed of being a television newsreader. Moira Stuart was a big role model, she said. Now she is back at Tonypandy Community College - or \"Pandy Comp\" - this time to speak to sixth formers. And she has a new career aspiration in mind - winning May's assembly election. Year 12's Georgia Harrison wants to know why someone from the traditional Labour stronghold of the Rhondda opted for Plaid Cymru? Ms Wood said being a traditional Labour stronghold has held the area back. Voters are not listened to, she said, and it is time to \"shake up the political system\". The message to this group of teenagers in the Rhondda - most of whom are too young to vote - is the same message Plaid will take across Wales in the election campaign. But are voters listening? There is not a huge amount of polling data yet, but what polls there are suggest Labour is still out in front, with Plaid battling for second place. \"The polls are not where I would like them to be at the moment,\" Ms Wood told me. \"I would obviously like to see some improvement, but I think that will be achieved by making sure that we communicate with people on the ground. \"We know that there's a limit to how much of our message we can get across through the media so it is all dependent on the grassroots conversations.\" Plaid's media profile was boosted last year when Ms Wood took part in the general election leaders' debates alongside David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nicola Sturgeon, Nigel Farage, Nick Clegg and Natalie Bennett. But the added publicity failed to translate into winning more seats in Parliament, in contrast to the near clean sweep of seats achieved by the Scottish Nationalists. The goal for Plaid now is to capitalise on that enhanced profile and to demonstrate that they are talking voters' language on the issues that matter most. Nine key policies - three each on health, education and the economy - will form the core of the party's assembly election campaign. It's \"absolutely clear\" that those three issues are voters' top priorities, Ms Wood said. \"And so they are our top priorities as well, and all of our focus has gone into providing solutions in those areas.\" But does she encounter people who pigeonhole the party, who think Plaid prioritises the Welsh language and the constitution above everything else? \"There are still misconceptions about Plaid Cymru,\" she says. \"I was in a meeting last night in Mountain Ash in the Cynon Valley talking about just exactly these things. \"It is up to our party workers to make sure that we scotch those misconceptions.\" Ms Wood is the first Plaid leader not to come from a Welsh-speaking background.

Van Gaal, already without 13 players, lost David de Gea during the warm-up and used an adage that means anything that can go wrong will go wrong. \"It is the law of Murphy I think,\" the Dutchman told BT Sport. \"A lot of things are happening in the heads of the players and in the first 10 or 15 minutes we were not so good.\" Van Gaal felt his side improved as the first half went on and could have scored more goals. But he added: \"In the second half we didn't win any duels, any second balls. You cannot afford a second goal, but we could have scored also. \"Jesse Lingard had two remarkable chances.\" At the end of the game, United fans in the MCH Arena made it clear they were not impressed with their side's display. Van Gaal accepted the second-half performance was not good enough, but defended the attitude of his players. \"The fans can criticise,\" he said. \"They can do it because when you see the second half, maybe they are right. We have to improve and then the fans shall support us again. \"All the players want to perform in an excellent way. It is not a case of attitude. We were not winning the second balls - that is my analysis.\" United's next game sees them face League One side Shrewsbury in the FA Cup fifth round on Monday night at New Meadow, looking to avoid an upset and a third consecutive defeat in all competitions. The Manchester Evening News called for Van Gaal to be sacked immediately in an article written by their United reporter Stuart Mathieson. \"I wrote 'enough is enough' after the dire display against Southampton less than a month ago believing it couldn't get any worse and that it shouldn't be allowed to,\" he wrote. \"But then this came this Joke in Jutland.\" Chief football writer for the Times, Henry Winter, told BBC Radio 5 live that the performance was appalling. \"It's definitely tick-tock time,\" he said. \"The press box there is very close to where the Manchester United power brokers were sitting.

The principal rooms are to be recreated as they were in the 18th Century. The 8th Earl of Onslow, whose family rebuilt the house in the 1720s, has said it should remain a ruin. The Palladian mansion near Guildford was bequeathed to the NT in 1956 by the Onslow family. About 95% of the Grade I-listed house, which featured in the 2008 film The Duchess starring Keira Knightley, was damaged. The trust said it was confident a number of principal rooms on the ground floor, including the Marble Hall, Speakers' Parlour and Saloon, could be restored. A spokesman said: \"The fact that so many features survived and items from the rooms are being recovered from the ashes made the case for restoration compelling. \"The enduring significance of the architect Leoni's original designs means it will go back instead to look at the 18th Century decorative schemes and layout of the house.\" The trust said the upper floors were \"less architecturally significant\" and had already been altered since the house was first built. Helen Ghosh, director general of the National Trust, said: \"The fire at Clandon was shocking, but gives us the opportunity not only to show our respect for the heritage of the past, but also to create new heritage for the future. \"The loss of so many of the contents of the house means that we cannot return it to how it looked the day before the fire. \"However, we now know more about the original layout and recognise that the enduring significance of the house is its architecture.\" The trust said it had looked at a number of options for the house to ensure Clandon Park remained open and accessible to the public. A spokesman said the cost of the work was expected to be met largely through the trust's insurance policy, although it would also be asking supporters for donations. Source: National Trust"

That was partly thanks to its successful Hacienda Classical gigs, where it covers acid house anthems. The judges said the orchestra had \"blazed a brilliant trail for what a 21st Century orchestra can do\". The Manchester Camerata played to 150,000 people in 2016 - up from 50,000 the previous year. Much of that was a result of Hacienda Classical, named after the legendary Manchester nightclub, which was created with former New Order bassist Peter Hook and veteran Hacienda DJs Mike Pickering and Graeme Park. It has attracted ravers to arenas and concert halls including the Royal Albert Hall - and will open the Pyramid Stage at this year's Glastonbury Festival. The Manchester Camerata has also been praised for branching out in other ways - from playing film soundtracks live, performing in rock venues and accompanying pianist Martha Argerich on tour, to working in care homes and schools. The orchestra has \"boldly re-invented itself\" in recent years and \"made itself an indispensable cultural asset\" in the north-west of England, according to the RPS judges. \"Through its exuberant Hacienda Classical events it has brought an entirely new audience to its concerts - and, more importantly, wooed them back again and again,\" the jury said. \"It has also done pioneering work in the crucial fields of education, health and wellbeing and community engagement.\" The first Hacienda Classical gigs were staged at Manchester's Bridgewater Hall last February - and Camerata chief executive Bob Riley says the atmosphere was unlike anything its musicians had experienced before. \"It was rammed full. They were just screaming in anticipation and joy,\" he recalls. \"So when you walked in there it was less of an audio experience and more of a physical one. \"You could actually feel what it was like for 2,500 people to be screaming in a concert hall. Then when the orchestra came on, it notched up several levels and you could see the looks on the orchestra's faces. It was really, 'Wow, what's happening here?'\" The reinvention dates back three years, when the orchestra decided to rethink its role in the face of dwindling audiences. \"Many of us sat down and questioned, why are we doing this?

The Holyland is a residential part of south Belfast popular with students. Employment and Learning Minister Stephen Farry is to meet residents' representatives on Monday afternoon. Eleven people were arrested in the area and the city centre over the St Patrick's Day period. One policeman was injured when bottles were thrown at officers in Agincourt Avenue. A number of vehicles were also damaged and residents complained about excessive noise and litter in their streets. There has been a history of trouble in the Holyland on previous St Patrick's Days and talks have been held before in a bid to prevent students engaging in anti-social behaviour. The chairman of the Holyland Regeneration Association, Ray Farley, said the existing measures had not worked and called for Stormont ministers to intervene. Speaking last Friday ahead of the meeting, Mr Farry said he was \"appalled\" by the behaviour of some young people in the area but said the majority of them were not university or college students. However, he added that further steps to address students' bad behaviour would now be considered in light of this year's trouble."

Researchers have been examining the artefacts from Henry VIII's warship, which was raised in 1982, to discover more about the ship's crew. Their work has revealed that many of those who perished when the boat sank in 1545 were \"superb athletes\". Sport physiologist Dr Nick Owen said the skeletons and objects raised with the Mary Rose have given them a \"wealth of information\". \"The abnormalities in some of the crew's radius bones shows that they'd have been supreme athletes,\" Dr Owen said. \"Today an Olympic bow has 48 lbs of tension, but to fire a Mary Rose bolt (arrow) would have taken well over 100 lbs.\" Dr Owen believes that as well as providing a glimpse into the past, his team's discoveries can offer an insight into the injuries of modern athletes. \"You can see similar abnormalities in elite tennis and squash players,\" he said. \"Top sportsmen are singled out for elite training from such a young age. \"The cream of archers on the Mary Rose would have been in training since they were seven years old.\" Dr Owen's team, including scientists from the University of Bradford, have already succeeded in creating an online 3D image of some of the sailors, which can be remotely studied by scientists. The next challenge is to see what lies inside the bones. \"Once we can conduct Micro CT scans, we'll be able to see what changes being one of Henry VIII's elite archers caused internally,\" Dr Owen explained. \"These very fine scans will help us discover how their lifestyle and diet affected their bone structure from the inside.\" The Mary Rose artefacts are on display to mark the university's research and innovation awards evening."

Samarco is owned by mining giants Vale, from Brazil, and Anglo-Australian company BHP Billiton. Vale and BHP Billiton \"made all possible effort to prioritise the needs of the people who were in the accident area\" on 5 November when the dams burst, it said in a statement. Samarco says the \"preliminary commitment\" it signed will guarantee payment for \"preventive emergency, mitigation, repair or compensation measures\". The authorities acknowledge that the amount agreed will not be enough to cover the damage to the environment and to the local population. \"This is only a first instalment,\" state prosecutor Carlos Eduardo Ferreira Pinto told O Estado de Minas newspaper. Last week, Brazilian environmental agency Ibama fined Samarco 250m reais (\u00c2\u00a343.6m; $66.3m). Ibama described the dam bursts as \"the worst mining accident in Brazil's history\". The village of Bento Rodrigues was totally destroyed. More than 500 people lost their homes there. Samarco could face even higher fines from environmental regulators for water pollution and damage to local areas. The mud is being tested for potential toxins from the mine. The cause of the dam breaches has not yet been determined, but one of the structures was being extended as part of an expansion project at the time."

Mr McGovern died after being punched during a night out in Omagh, County Tyrone, on New Year's Eve in 2012. Jurors will return to Dungannon Crown Court on Friday to resume their deliberations. In his closing speech to the jury, a prosecution lawyer said Mr Donnelly was either a \"cowardly liar\" or the \"unluckiest man alive\". However, a defence lawyer said evidence from a key witness identifying Mr Donnelly as the attacker was \"a catalogue of errors\" and \"mistaken in a number of key respects\". The judge told jurors the key issue was the question: \"Did the defendant strike the blow in the Weigh Inn car park?\" The prosecution lawyer said Mr McGovern, despite \"extreme provocation\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 did his best to defuse a volatile situation\". He said Mr Donnelly was \"a man who would do anything to save his own skin\" and had attempted to \"hoodwink\" and \"pull the wool\" over the eyes of the jury. He claimed the defendant was responsible for both a \"cowardly punch\" and a \"cowardly denial\" and he was \"not brave enough to admit\" what he had done. The prosecutor said if Mr Donnelly was innocent, he was a \"very unlucky man\" in being identified by a witness, and being filmed on CCTV in the area seconds before and after the assault. He told the jury: \"Because the (CCTV) camera doesn't show him hitting Jason McGovern he's thinking he's going to fool you into thinking he didn't throw the punch. It's just a charade.\" He added: \"You may think he is the unluckiest man alive or he is guilty. I say there is no doubt about that. Mark Donnelly is guilty of manslaughter. Mark Donnelly is guilty of punching Jason McGovern.\" In summing up the defence case, a lawyer told the jury that there were \"too many problems with the evidence of (the key prosecution witness) for you to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of this young man\". He said the witness had admitted that she could have made a mistake and pointed to the evidence in the witness box of Mr Donnelly, who had said: \"I say that she is mistaken. I did not strike anyone down by the Weigh Inn car park.\" He said even if the jury took the view that Mr Donnelly had been lying, the jury \"must not assume for that reason the defendant is guilty of the offence of manslaughter\". The judge told the jury that the death of Mr McGovern was \"very emotive\", but they must approach their task \"quite clinically\"."

That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said. Labour said new homes were urgently needed but \"driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods\" was not the answer. In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart. Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be \"less of it\". \"The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town. \"People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,\" he said. He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented. The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"This is something that councils can choose to do already. \"Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years. \"They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently. \"If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at.\" But Labour said the coalition's \"failed\" polices were \"making the housing crisis worse not better\". Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: \"Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.\" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and \"put unemployed builders back to work\" and boost the construction industry. 'Lucky family' Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says. This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to \u00a3159bn if sold. It says London alone has more than \u00a370bn of expensive social housing. About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said. This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising \u00a35.5bn a year. The figure would stand at \u00a34.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said. Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but"

Tom Westley made 61 for Essex and Ryan ten Doeschate was last to go for 50 as they were all out for 213.

      "text": "Culture Secretary Maria Miller said \"decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table\" during the BBC's charter review before 2017. The BBC said changing the law could lead to more people failing to pay. In 2012 about 155,000 were convicted and fined for not paying the \u00a3145.50 fee. In total 180,000 people were prosecuted for not paying their licence - which is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device - accounting for more than one in 10 criminal prosecutions that year. In October 2013 Huffington Post reported that in response to a Freedom of Information Request the Ministry of Justice had revealed that 107 people were jailed between January 2011 and March 2013 for failing to pay fines related to not having a TV licence. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has now told the Daily Telegraph \"serious work\" would be done on the proposal to make non-payment a civil offence and that it could ease the pressure on criminal courts. He said: \"The culture secretary and I both agree that this is a really interesting idea - particularly given the pressure on our courts system. \"Our departments will be doing some serious work on the proposal.\" Ms Miller said: \"This is an interesting idea but timing is crucial and decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table during charter review, not separate to the process.'' The BBC's current Royal Charter, which expires in 2016, sets out how it should be funded, what it does and how it is managed. A spokesman for the culture secretary added: \"Maria will put decriminalisation of the licence fee on the table during charter review discussions, but to do it before makes no sense. \"She has made clear that the BBC needs to get its house in order, particularly when it comes to governance and transparency, having decriminalisation on the table during the negotiations will focus the BBC's minds.\" But Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen is seeking to introduce the change through an amendment to the government's Deregulation Bill. It would make non-payment of the licence fee a civil matter, with a fine for offenders set by the government. He told the Daily Telegraph: \"It is outrageous that so many people are brought in to the criminal justice system through this means. \"I believe that non-payment should be treated in the way that parking tickets are. \"It is absurd that the courts are being clogged up by such a minor offence.\" The newspaper reported that the amendment had been backed by 101 cross-party MPs. A BBC spokesman said: \"Legislation is a matter for the government, however changing the law could lead to higher evasion. \"Just a 1% increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around \u00a335m, the equivalent of around 10 BBC local radio stations.\""

Only five others have won a medal at the World Athletics Championships. Liz McColgan is still the only Scot to have tasted individual success. That 10,000m gold in Tokyo back in 1991 will live long in the memory. Her daughter, Eilish, 10th over half the distance this year, is now hunting down mum's 5,000m personal best. Three Scots have stood on World Championships relay podiums and Clark is one of them. Eilidh Doyle, who took silver along with Clark this time round, and Lee McConnell are serial medallists as part of the 400m relay squad. In the sprint relay, the former European 200m champion, Dougie Walker, helped the British team to bronze in Athens in 1997. An honourable mention for Kirsten McAslan too. Not selected for the final, she nonetheless got a bronze medal two years ago in Beijing for helping the British team through the heats before watching them take third in the final. So half a dozen Scots have World Championships medals on the mantelpiece. We very nearly had two more in London. Media playback is not supported on this device Surely the best Scottish performer was Kilbarchan AC's Callum Hawkins, who followed up a fine top-10 performance at last summer's Rio Olympics with a superb fourth place in the marathon. He might not have seen the crown jewels along the way in an event that started and finished at Tower Bridge, but he was agonisingly within sight of a historic bronze. As it is, no British man has bettered his performance in a World Championships marathon. If Hawkins thought he was close to a medal, spare a thought for Laura Muir. Beaten to the bronze by seven one hundredths of a second. No wonder she collapsed to the track after the photo-finish with South Africa's Caster Semenya, unable and unwilling to look at the giant scoreboard that beamed out confirmation of her agony. Her time will come, though. Don't take my word for it: take Brendan Foster's. The English long-distance legend has made a solemn promise to BBC Scotland: Muir will be a major championship gold medallist within four years. We'll hold him to that, shall we? As well as the two silver medallists, and two fourth-placers, there were other fine performances from by far the biggest Scottish contingent ever to join a British team for the World Athletics Championships. In the 5,000m, Andy Butchart has a tough act to follow after Sir Mo Farah's retirement from the track, but he's finished in the top 10 at the Olympics and now the World Championships and surely has a great future ahead. Perhaps the best gauge of improvement is the contrast between these World Championships and the London Olympics. In 2012, only five Scots competed in track and field. None made a final. Fast forward five years and we have 16 Scots making the team; two winning medals and their compatriots qualifying for seven finals. The"

They squeeze between the luxury condos in downtown Kuala Lumpur to arrive at a squatters area that has become so permanent, it has its own name - Bellamy Village. Ms Khong says initially it was hard to find the needy because they were largely hidden in Kuala Lumpur. \"They are afraid of the authorities so they always hide in the alleys,\" she says. Her drive to find and feed the poor has led to the founding of one of Malaysia's biggest soup kitchens called Kechara, which is a Sanskrit word Ms Khong says she borrowed from Buddhist teachings to mean a \"heavenly place\". The Malaysian media have ranked Ms Khong as one of the most influential Malaysians and her work earned her a place among Forbes magazine's heroes of philanthropy list in 2010. However, her journey to become a full-time volunteer has not always been a willing one. Before starting the soup kitchen, Ms Khong's idea of charity involved dressing up in ball gowns and donating money. Perhaps this was why Malaysia ranked below its poorer neighbours such as Indonesia and the Philippines in the 2013 World Giving Index, which judged a country based on its donation of both money and time. The mother of three preferred to dine at luxury hotels, and at one point owned a tropical island in Myanmar with her husband. \"She was a socialite. She would go out clubbing, attend parties and events. She would have fancy dinners with her friends and play tennis. She really indulged in herself personally,\" says Ms Khong's son, Clifford. It's rare for children in Asia to criticize their parents but Ms Khong doesn't seem to mind. \"I admit it. I think being the youngest in the family meant that life was pretty pampered,\" she says laughing. \"It was always about myself, what I wanted and that continued on for a while until 1994,\" she says. That year, she was on a quest for spiritual guidance in India and met a Buddhist monk named Tsem Rinpoche. \"I was decked out from head to toe in Chanel.\" Ms Khong says if he had discouraged her from wearing luxury brands, she probably wouldn't have followed him. Instead, he urged her to use her wealth and influence to do more charity and eventually suggested that she feed the hungry. \"I was very reluctant to give up my weekends with family and friends,\" says Ms Khong. She says she only committed herself to volunteer for two weekends out of the year. That was in 2006. Now, feeding the poor is her full-time occupation. \"Once I started there is no way that I could pull out because these people are there and they need us,\" she says. The Kechara soup kitchen has branches across the country in the capital Kuala Lumpur, north of the country in Penang, Johor Bahru in the south and Kuantan in the east.

The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are \"urgently\" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to \"open their hearts and homes\" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. \"Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,\" she said. \"I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. \"They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. \"They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman.\" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: \"As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. \"We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. \"In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. \"A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members.\" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. \"We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.\""

      "text": "An international team has shown that the top few millimetres of the sea is rich in secretions from phytoplankton. The group\u2019s tests demonstrate that this microscopic material can nucleate ice crystals if lifted into the atmosphere by crashing waves and sea spray. If this is a very prevalent process, it likely alters cloud properties, the researchers tell the journal Nature. A greater or lesser abundance of ice will affect the clouds\u2019 lifetimes, their precipitation potential, and whether they behave as a blanket to warm the atmosphere, or as a bright shield to reflect sunlight, thus having a cooling effect. It is yet another factor that climate models will have to consider, says study lead Dr Theo Wilson from the University of Leeds, UK. \"Our understanding of cloud formation is actually pretty poor, and we need to understand better how ice is made so that modellers can better represent it,\" he told BBC News. Wilson\u2019s team visited the Arctic, the northwestern Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific. The scientists used a remote-controlled boat to trawl the top \"microlayer\" of these waters to see what sort of organic material it held. Phytoplankton are clearly present, but these organisms, as small as they are, are really too big to be wafted high into the sky. However, the plants also excrete matter. These \"exudates\", as they are known, are gel-like, and their scale is on the order of 0.2-0.02 micrometers. This means they are capable of being carried skyward. \"This 'goo' is the sort of material that will get into the fine fraction of sea spray aerosol, which is the part of the sea spray that is going to make it high into the atmosphere,\" explained Dr Wilson. His team shows that the exudates can become Ice Nucleating Particles (INPs) in the atmosphere. \"Exactly why they\u2019re good at making ice is still not clear,\" said co-researcher Dr Luis Ladino from the University of Toronto, Canada. \"It could be because their structure is similar to ice; it could be because they have some affinity to have hydrogen bonds; or some other favourable chemistry at their surface. There are probably many components, and you can\u2019t say it\u2019s just one.\" The effect of organic INPs is most relevant in those parts of the globe where desert dusts or pollution particles - long-recognised triggers for ice formation in clouds \u2013 are much reduced. These locations would be the more remote regions on Earth, such as at the poles or in the Southern Ocean. Here, organic INPs could be playing a much more significant, and hitherto unrecognised, role in the freeze-up of clouds. Modellers will need to be aware of this as they simulate future climate scenarios, says the team. In the Arctic, for example, the well-documented reduction in sea-ice is opening up ocean water for longer periods of the year, allowing winds to more freely act on the surface to produce waves and sea spray. The open ocean is likely also to boost phytoplankton production with more sunlight getting into the top water layers. \"And in the Southern Ocean, a big"

Alain Juppe insisted his proposals were \"deep and credible\" but lacked the \"brutality\" of Mr Fillon's plans. It was the final Republicans party debate before Sunday's concluding vote. The Republicans candidate is widely expected to face far-right National Front (FN) leader Marine Le Pen in a runoff vote in the presidential election next May. Self-declared supporters of the centre-right values are choosing between the two former prime ministers. It is the party's first such primary vote, modelled on the US system. Seven candidates were whittled down to two last Sunday, with Mr Fillon taking an unexpectedly decisive lead of 44.1% to Mr Juppe's 28.5%. Juppe v Fillon: Battle of France's conservatives Press review: France's 'Mr Nobody' Francois Fillon Fillon under fire over women's rights The past week has seen a campaign marked by a bitter row over the nature Mr Fillon's social policies. Mr Juppe provoked a furious reaction when he questioned whether Mr Fillon, a Roman Catholic, could seek to challenge the legality of abortion. But polling suggests such tactics seem to have backfired on Mr Juppe, once the favourite seen as the safe choice. A poll of 908 debate viewers by Elabe suggested 71% of conservative respondents found Mr Fillon more convincing, as did 57% of viewers of all political stripes. \"It is true that my project is more radical and perhaps more difficult,\" said Mr Fillon. His controversial economic reforms include cutting half a million public sector jobs and scrapping the 35-hour work week, prompting comparisons to the late British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Mr Juppe also proposes cutting jobs and liberalising work hours, though to a lesser extent. Both propose roughly similar cuts to public spending of at least \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100bn (\u00c2\u00a385bn; $106bn). \"I've got a plan for the reforms I want to make in the first three months of the presidential term - and I'm convinced if we don't get these changes implemented in the first three months, the French people will feel disheartened, they'll turn away from politics, and then there'll be a greater risk of the extremists winning,\" Mr Fillon said. The country was \"on the brink of revolt\", which could only be averted with such radical action. Conservative Le Figaro says the debate \"eased tensions on the right\" and showed the two contenders \"have already formed identical visions and almost similar projects\" - in particular the need to end the \"vicious cycle of spending and debt\". They have \"some differences on security, education and migration, but they are minor\", concludes its political editor. But centre-left Le Monde's political correspondent disagrees, seeing \"significant differences\" on the European Union, Russia and Syria. While Mr Fillon wants to \"respect the sovereignty\" of EU member states, Mr Juppe favours a \"powerful EU as a future world power\". On Syria, Mr Fillon wants to put France \"back in play\" by \"opening a channel to Damascus\", whereas Mr Juppe wants to \"boost transatlantic co-operation\" and takes a"

Portsmouth manager Paul Cook told BBC Radio Solent: Media playback is not supported on this device \"It's a fantastic point, but never ever at any stage were we playing well in the game or we were in control of the game. \"I thought Yeovil were excellent on the day.

Bob and his friend Hector McMillan were missionaries working in Congo during the chaos that followed the country's independence from Belgium in 1960. In July 1964, Bob, Hector, their wives and children and other missionaries were taken hostage and held for four months in the city of Stanleyville (now known as Kisangi). On 24 November 1964, the defeated rebel leadership ordered its troops to flee and kill as many white people as they could. \"Hector and I were taken outside,\" says Bob. \"As we were walking out, they suddenly opened fire on Hector and he was killed by four bullets in the back. \"Then they turned their guns on me and opened fire in all directions. \"One bullet grazed me on the forehead and I threw myself down and played dead and they passed me by. \"Hector's children witnessed his murder.\" Bob, his family and the rest of the hostages were eventually rescued, but they had to leave Hector's body behind. Bob's daughter Ruth remembers the terrifying journey to freedom. \"I remember being in the jeep and a Cuban man had me perched on one knee and a machine gun on the other,\" she says. \"He was shooting all over the road and I remember feeling the hot shells falling on my body.\" \"They sped us to the airport as fast as possible,\" adds Bob. \"The plane was laden with stretchers. It was just taking off when a rebel shot at us puncturing a fuel tank and the pilot just about got us to safety.\" The McAllisters spent three decades living and working in Congo. Hector McMillan was not the only friend the family lost during that time. His late wife Alma's best friend Ruby Gray from Dromara was murdered along with five other missionaries, close to the town of Banalia. Says Bob's youngest son David: \"The killing of the six missionaries was very savage. \"They weren't carried out by gun, these were machete and spear killings. None of us can understand why. \"Some of the missionaries' bodies were thrown in the river and eaten by crocodiles. \"Local people say that when they threw Ruby into the river after she had been speared, she wasn't dead. And as she was sinking, she raised her hands and her last words were 'Glory to God'\". In 2014, Bob, now 90, returned to Congo with his eldest son Billy and daughter Ruth to visit Hector's grave and attend a memorial service in Banalia to honour the six missionaries, including Ruby, who were murdered by Simba rebels. The Simbas had emerged out of the chaos that followed Congo's independence. The movement's leaders aspired to a communist state, but most of their followers were illiterate tribesmen steeped in black magic and witchcraft who were simply looking for the better life they had been promised after independence. The McAllister's trip is documented in BBC One Northern Ireland programme, A Deadly Mission: Belfast to Congo, which will be broadcast"

The FBI said it had, \"this past weekend\", been shown a way to unlock the iPhone used by San Bernardino gunman Rizwan Farook. The FBI has until 5 April to let the court know how it gets on. If the method doesn't work, and the phone is still locked, we'll probably return to Riverside for the hearing. If it is successful - then, well, who knows what will happen? Uncharted waters. The case, already the most fascinating tech legal tussle for years, enters murky territory. And here's why. Let's say, for arguments sake, that the FBI does indeed have a new, credible method of getting into the iPhone. Where on Earth did it come from? Apple's bewilderment is understandable given that, right up until the final hour, the FBI had insisted it had exhausted every possible route. It told Congress as much. In a hearing earlier this month, FBI director James Comey stood firm as Congressman Darrell Issa gave him a dramatic dressing down for not pursuing a technique known as mirroring - essentially, and I'm simplifying here, duplicating the phone so repeated attempts can be made to unlock it without disturbing the original. Mr Comey said he'd look into it - though that was 20 days ago. Also during that congressional hearing, Mr Issa pressed Mr Comey on whether he had asked the National Security Agency (NSA) for its help. In response, Mr Comey, making reference to the particular model of iPhone and the software contained on it, said: \"We have engaged all parts of the US government to see does anybody have a way, short of asking Apple to do it, with a 5C running iOS 9 - to do this, and we do not.\" Had Tuesday's hearing gone ahead, we were expecting to hear the witness testimony of Stacey Perino, an FBI electronics engineer, and Christopher Pluhar, a computer forensics professor from California State University. Both were due to underline that Apple, and only Apple, would be able to break into the phone. Prof Pluhar, who is a supervisory agent for the FBI, had in the past said he had been \"unable to identify any other methods feasible for gaining access to the currently inaccessible data stored within the subject device\". But we're being told to put all that aside for a moment because the FBI has said it is \"cautiously optimistic\" a new method suggested by an as-yet unknown \"outside party\" could solve all its problems, allowing investigators access to the iPhone without Apple's help. Apple's legal team has said it has no idea what that vulnerability could be - but it, of course, didn't rule out the possibility it existed. After all, it's software - and no piece of software ever written has even been watertight. Every time you update your phone, computer, tablet, it's often to plug a few new security holes. So if, come 5 April, the FBI"

Blatter brushed off suggestions, from the British government among others, that Wednesday's presidential election - for which he is the only candidate - should be suspended. \"If governments try to intervene then something is wrong,\" he said. \"I think Fifa is strong enough that we can deal with our problems inside Fifa.\" Blatter, unusually appearing alone at a news conference in Zurich, gave a defiant display despite the storm surrounding the organisation. \"This was an absolutely extraordinary appearance by Sepp Blatter. Delusional, one colleague said to me afterwards. \"The phrase that will stick in the mind is: 'Crisis? What crisis?' - reminiscent of that famous newspaper headline during the Winter of Discontent. \"But Blatter is not playing to our audience, he's playing to the members of Fifa who he hopes will re-elect him. \"He wouldn't deal with Mohamed Bin Hammam's suspension, wouldn't talk about Jack Warner and his claims and wouldn't talk about reopening the World Cup 2022 vote. \"After this conference there are so many questions. This is not going away for Blatter.\" But he ended the news conference in an angry exchange with a German reporter and talked of his time working as a journalist, complaining about a lack of \"respect\" from some members of the media, warning them: \"We are not in a bazaar; we are in Fifa's house.\" The 75-year-old Blatter insisted that a Football Association inquiry by barrister James Dingemans QC looking into ex-FA and bid chairman Lord Triesman's claims of alleged Fifa impropriety had \"found no elements\" which would prompt the world governing to investigate further. This despite Dingemans' report revealing that Fifa executive committee Nicolas Leoz's aide had asked for the FA Cup to be named after the Paraguayan Exco member, who Triesman claimed in Parliament had demanded a knighthood from England's 2018 bid. Fifa has now published a summary of Dingemans' report on its website. Sports minister Hugh Robertson had expressed the British government's displeasure at Fifa's situation last week, calling for its presidential election to be suspended. But Blatter argued neither governments nor anyone outside the Fifa membership could have any bearing on the election process, and vowed to carry on unless Wednesday's congress decided otherwise. \"If somebody wants to change something in the election or in the congress of Wednesday, these are the members of Fifa,\" he said. Media playback is not supported on this device \"This cannot be done by the executive committee, it cannot be done by any authorities outside of Fifa - it's only the congress itself that can do it. \"Congress will decide if I am a valid or non-valid candidate.\" Blatter is expected to stand unopposed in an election marred by a torrent of dissent from within and beyond football's world governing body. The only rival candidate to emerge - Mohamed Bin Hammam, president of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) - pulled out having been suspended by Fifa's own ethics committee over allegations that financial incentives"

The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained \"absolutely committed\" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. \"Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',\" he said. \"Their judgement did, however, require us to change the provisions relating to information sharing. \"Since the judgement, we have undertaken an intensive period of engagement with children, young people, parents, carers, practitioners and professionals. \"I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people.\" The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were \"not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament\". And they said the legislation made it \"perfectly possible\" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a \"wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware\". The appeal was brought by the No to Named Persons (NO2NP) coalition, which includes the Christian Institute, Care (Christian Action Research and Education), Tyme Trust and the Family Education Trust. The Scottish government has said previously it would not commence the legislation until the problems were fixed."

However, the deal still needs to be approved by the Canadian government which has launched a review to assess its benefit to Canada. If approved, the deal will be China's largest foreign business takeover. \"The offer is a compelling one, and offers benefits for all Nexen's stakeholders, including employees and communities,\" CNOOC spokesman Peter Hunt was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. \"CNOOC Limited will continue to pursue all regulatory approvals required to close the transaction.\" While Nexen shareholders have backed the deal, there seems to be growing opposition to it among politicians and even the general public in Canada. Canada's biggest opposition party, the New Democratic Party (NDP), has voiced its concerns over the deal. \"We're very concerned about the potential sale of a strategic Canadian asset, not only to a foreign enterprise, but one that is wholly controlled by a foreign government that doesn't follow the same market rules as Canada,\" said Thomas Mulcair, leader of the NDP. \"The question is how can it be in Canada's interest, how can it be of a net benefit to Canada, to sell a strategic natural resource to a corporation that is wholly owned by a foreign country?\" Meanwhile, according to a latest survey conducted by Abacus Data, 69% of Canadians are also against the deal, while only 8% approve of it, with the rest being unsure. \"A majority of those opposed to the deal (58%) cited the fact that Nexen operates in one of Canada's core strategic industries, and a foreign company should not have control of such an important resource,\" Abacus Data said. Mr Mulcair added that the survey indicated that \"Canadians share our concerns\". Canada's government has the right to block any foreign investments over 330m Canadian dollars if it believes they are not in the country's best interests. CNOOC, which is China's biggest offshore oil producer, has made commitments to ensure the authorities that the deal will bring benefit to the country. It has said that it will retain Nexen employees and make Nexen's Calgary office as its headquarters for North and Central America. It has also offered to list shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Kevin Reinhart, Nexen's interim chief executive, said the Chinese firm also wanted to keep the Nexen brand name. \"This transaction will in no way close the book on Nexen or our way of doing business,\" he said."

Conor Murray scored two points at Corrigan Park as the Saffrons moved into an early 0-4 to 0-1 lead, but Ross Munnelly and David Conway were on target as Louth levelled. The decisive period in the game came just before the break with McGourty's goal and the dismissal of O'Connor. Antrim led 1-5 to 0-6 at half-time but Laois levelled on the restart thanks to points from Ambrose Doran and Alan Farrell. Paddy McBride restored the host's advantage only for James Finn to make it all-square again. CJ McGourty slotted over three of Antrim's final four points as they edged clear to clinch a valuable win to leave the Ulster side sixth in the standings. \"If we didn't get the two points from this game we would be up against it,\" said Antrim joint-manager Gearoid Adams. \"CJ McGourty led by example with pressure frees and we got over the line - we must push on now.\" There was a dramatic opening at the Gaelic Grounds with Forker red-carded after 50 seconds followed by McKeever's goal and the exit of Williams on 10 minutes.

The doctor, of Ilford, London, denies the charge in what is the first prosecution of its kind in the UK. A second man, Hasan Mohamed, 41, denies encouraging and abetting the offence. Female genital mutilation, often abbreviated to FGM and also known as female circumcision, involves procedures that include the partial or total removal of the external female genital organs for cultural or other non-medical reasons. It is practised in 29 countries in Africa and some countries in Asia and the Middle East, but is illegal in the UK. Carrying out female genital mutilation carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. The mother-of-two, who cannot be identified, first underwent FGM aged six in Somalia, London's Southwark Crown Court heard. She was 24 and living in Britain when she give birth to her first child in November 2012. The court heard that during labour, her FGM stitches were torn and Dr Dharmasena, a junior registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology, sewed her back up in a procedure that amounted to FGM. The prosecution alleges the doctor did so at Mr Mohamed's \"insistence or encouragement\". Kate Bex, prosecuting, told jurors that FGM was \"very dangerous for a woman's health and psychological well-being\". \"It can lead to severe health problems and, in some cases, to death. FGM causes gynaecological, urological and obstetric problems in women, chronic pain and sexual dysfunction,\" she said. \"It increases the risk of death in childbirth to both mother and baby.\" Jurors heard the woman would have been most exposed to these side-effects when the surgery was first performed when she was six. Dr Dharmasena's stitches would not have carried the same risks, but should not have been sewn at all \"unless medically necessary\", Ms Bex said. The hospital trust launched an investigation into the incident within a few weeks. In a statement, Dr Dharmasena said he had carried out the procedure because he thought the woman wanted him to. He also said Mr Mohamed had urged him to do so. He said: \"At no point in time did I intentionally or deliberately want to cause any harm to the patient. I had obeyed all of the patient's wishes.\" But jurors were told he had changed his justification when he was interviewed by police in August 2013. Ms Bex said: \"It would seem that Dr Dharmasena had familiarised himself with the law and you may feel that he changed tack as a result.\" Ten months after the operation, he raised the possibility that it had been \"medically justified\", she told the court. Dr Dharmasena denies one count of female genital mutilation. Mr Mohamed denies one count of aiding or abetting the procedure, and one count of intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence. The trial continues."

They say the confusion may lie in the way the brain receives information from different parts of the body. Distorted perception may dominate in some people, leading to body image problems, a US journal reports. Lead researcher Dr Matthew Longo said: \"These findings may well be relevant to psychiatric conditions involving body image such as anorexia nervosa, as there may be a general bias towards perceiving the body to be wider than it is. \"Our results show dramatic distortions of hand shape, which were highly consistent across participants.\" In the study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Dr Longo's team asked 18 volunteers to take part in an experiment. The volunteers were asked to put their left hands palm down under a board and judge the location of the covered hand's knuckles and fingertips with a pointer. This revealed striking distortions - the volunteers tended to misjudge their hands as wider and their fingers as shorter than they actually were. The researchers say the distortions are subconscious and involve the ability known as position sense that the brain uses to know where all parts of the body are in space even when the eyes are closed. Dr Longo said: \"Of course we know what our hand really looks like, and our participants were very accurate picking out a photo of their own hand from a set of photos with various distortions of hand shape. \"So there is clearly a conscious visual image of the body as well. But that visual image seems not to be used for position sense.\" Susan Ringwood, chief executive of the eating disorders charity Beat, said: \"We know that one of the features of anorexia nervosa can be distorted body image. \"People affected can truly believe that they are grossly fat, even when they are dangerously underweight. \"They are able to judge other people's bodies quite accurately and would describe someone else the same size as themselves correctly, but still not be able to do that about their own weight and shape. \"This brain study may give some insight into how this could be possible, and could be very motivating for people with eating disorders to know that there was a biological explanation for their experiences, rather than feeling it was their fault.\""

President Jacob Zuma was among those who conveyed their condolences to the family of \"the special child of South Africa\". She was known as the \"First Lady\" by her friends and family. Local broadcaster Enca called her the country's \"champion of positivity\". Africa Live: More updates on this and other stories In a tribute her family wrote: \"We will miss you sorely, Tsontso, our first lady. May you find eternal peace among the angels. Rest in Peace\". She called herself the first lady because she was the first black woman in South Africa to be diagnosed with progeria. Ontlametse loved life, lived it to the full, and never wished that she was born in any other way. This is what South Africans will remember her for. She rose to prominence a few years ago when a documentary was made of her life. Ms Phalatse used her new-found fame to motivate people to get on with their lives. In the process, she touched the hearts of many South Africans. The country got to share in some of her special moments and milestones - her 16th birthday, a school graduation ball and more recently her 18th birthday party spent with President Jacob Zuma. Ontlametse died surrounded by her family, who described her as having a \"courageous spirit\". Her legacy at 18 is not taking life's precious moments for granted. President Zuma led a minute's silence for Ms Phalatse on his 75th birthday and said he had planned to give her a car. \"A brave young fighter has fallen. May her spirit inspire all others living with disabilities or facing any difficulty, to soldier on as she did and live life to the fullest. We are really proud of her,\" he said in a statement.

Paul Pogba had hit a post moments earlier as the game came alive in the second period, following a first half in which neither of the bitter rivals managed a shot on target. City boss Pep Guardiola made nine changes to his side, who are now six games without a win in all competitions - his worst run as a manager. Their best chance arrived early on when Kelechi Iheanacho headed over from six yards, while second-half substitutes Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero made little impact. Victory was United's second in five matches, and only Jose Mourinho's fourth win in 18 meetings with Guardiola. Former Chelsea and Real Madrid manager Mourinho said on Wednesday his life in Manchester is \"a bit of a disaster\". His words and United's poor form created a sense that defeat at Old Trafford would prompt tough headlines, and Mourinho admitted recent displays influenced his choice to make only four changes and retain key names. United, far from at their best, scored during their only spell of quality in the opening 10 minutes of the second half as Ibrahimovic - anonymous in the opening period - profited from Nicolas Otamendi's missed header to square for Mata. There remain areas of concern for United. Luke Shaw was constantly outwitted by Jesus Navas and again there was no place in the 18-man squad for \u00a326m summer signing Henrik Mkhitaryan. But while Guardiola said the competition was his \"lowest priority\" before kick-off, Mourinho perhaps took the chance to shift United's momentum. Guardiola said City must be \"more clinical\" after they ended the night without working David de Gea once - the first time they have not had a shot on target in a game since 2012. City, who are top of the Premier League, had an early penalty appeal turned down when Michael Carrick tangled with Aleix Garcia. The wholesale changes made for the tie may blur detailed analysis of just what is amiss in recent weeks, but a switch to a 4-4-2 formation after two league games where a back three was used perhaps shows Guardiola has not yet settled on the way forward at City. He could also face more time without captain Vincent Kompany, who, making only his second start of the season, asked to be replaced at half-time because he was tired. Kompany suffered a groin strain in September but has been dogged by thigh and calf issues, prompting his playing time to fall from around over 2,700 minutes in 2013-14 to 1,700 last season. There were some positives for Guardiola as 19-year-old full-back Pablo Maffeo made made some key interventions but if City fail to win on Saturday they would be seven matches without a win, a dire run not endured since 2004. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho on responding to Sunday's 4-0 league defeat at Chelsea: \"We were on a good run of results but it was a big defeat - numbers"

They shouldn't be playing again.\" Fleming, 31, and his partner Jonathan Erlich, were beaten 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the first round of the Australian Open on Wednesday by Robin Haase and Fernando Verdasco. \"The key thing about sport is that it's pure, you don't know the outcome of any given match, and that's what people pay to come and watch,\" he added. \"You never know what's going to happen. That's key and they have to preserve that. \"I've never been approached to take money or anything to fix a match or lose a match. It does go on because people have been banned at lower levels. I'm surprised to see the article come out and talk about higher levels; I certainly haven't been aware of anything going on there.\" The Scot said he had no idea as to the identity of the suspected match-fixers, and suggested additional funding could be granted to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU), set-up to police the sport. \"Your guess is as good as mine,\" he said of those involved. \"There were no names in the article because it's very difficult to prove anything. I think that's the issue the TIU has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty. \"It can just be people throwing money on a match.\" Fleming was adamant, though, that no such activities were occurring in Melbourne. \"I think if you're sitting at home or buying a ticket to come and watch here at the Aussie Open, I've no doubt in my mind you're watching pure sporting theatre,\" he said. \"Players going at it and the best player winning on that day.

Ms Teal was previously arrested for protesting against the tree removals. Charges against her and 13 others were dropped earlier this year. More stories from across Yorkshire Sheffield City Council maintain that the removal of street trees in the city is lawful and necessary. A \"pre-action protocol letter\" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in \"direct action\", from taking part in future protests. The council said the process would give protesters \"a chance to further and finally consider their position\" before it begins legal proceedings on 12 July. Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of \"unlawful and costly disruption\" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. \"We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,\" he added. \"But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out.\" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. \"Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,\" he added. \"In addition, it presents us with a unique opportunity to sustainably manage, increase and maintain our diverse street tree stock over a 25 year period.\" The council said, despite the letter, works were still being disrupted \"causing city-wide delays\"."

His recent protest, which began on 12 June, cost emergency services \u00a31.4m and the wider economy an estimated \u00a328m. He pleaded guilty at Leicester Crown Court to causing a public nuisance. Judge Adrienne Lucking QC told him his protest was a \"childish response to your beef with the police\". \"Your actions had a direct economic impact on the constabulary and the wider economy,\" she said. Muton, 45, of no fixed address, was found guilty of the same offence by a jury in 2003, after he brought the M1 to a standstill for 10 hours by threatening to hang himself from a bridge. He was jailed for 18 months at the time. In 2007 he was arrested for attempting to jump off a bridge, and was Tasered by police while he was in custody. The court heard this was one of the reasons behind his most recent protest; he had also claimed to have been abused as a child. Muton has made 34 complaints to police in the past, plus appeals to the Independent Police Complaints Commission but none have been resolved in his favour. Days before his most recent protest he phoned police anonymously saying there was going to be a demonstration, but he did not say where and exactly when. Muton also wrote a Facebook message warning about his plan and alleging police had \"covered up\" child abuse. The court heard that no charges have ever been brought in relation to the alleged child abuse. Leicestershire Police said it would not be commenting on Muton's claims of corruption. He climbed the information board gantry between Coalville and Loughborough on the southbound carriageway at about midday at 12 June, and wrote messages alleging that someone \"tried 2 kill me\" and referring to \"2 murder attempts\". Police tried to talk him down but he was abusive and threatened to jump. He eventually came down at about 16:00 BST the following day after the IPCC arrived. The gantry was near East Midlands Airport and the court heard that cars were abandoned by people trying to catch flights, which hundreds of them missed. Angela Clark, District Crown Prosecutor at CPS East Midlands, said Muton had \"set out to cause the maximum disruption possible\". \"The regular users of the road were affected and there were also thousands of people due to leave Donington Park from the Download festival at that point,\" she said. \"People reported missing flights at the nearby East Midlands Airport, vehicle breakdowns and some accidents resulting from overcrowded roads.\" In mitigation, Muton's lawyer said he knew what he did was wrong, apologised and wanted to put it behind him. But the judge said his \"one-man protest\" was \"so serious and had such a significant impact, a clear message must be sent\". Muton claimed police closed the motorway to \"wind him up\", but Leicestershire Police defended their actions. Assistant Chief Constable Phil Kay said: \"Our priority from the outset was the"

The city was rocked by riots in April when a black man died after suffering injuries in police custody. Six officers were charged over the death of the 25-year-old, Freddie Gray. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had \"served this city with distinction\" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said \"too many continue to die\". \"The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,\" she told reporters, adding: \"We need to get the crime surge under control.\" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death. The US justice department is also conducting a civil rights review of the Baltimore force and Mr Batts has been criticised by the city's police union. Earlier on Wednesday, the union released its report into the police handling of the rioting. It said officers had complained \"that they lacked basic riot equipment, training, and, as events unfolded, direction from leadership\". The report also said \"officers repeatedly expressed concern that the passive response to the civil unrest had allowed the disorder to grow into full scale rioting\". Recent events had \"placed attention on police leadership\", Ms Rawlings-Blake said, but denied her decision was influenced by the union report. Mr Davis, who is taking over immediately as interim police chief, praised his \"friend\" Mr Batts and said he was a \"true reform commissioner\". Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Davis would \"bring accountability to police, hold officers who act out of line accountable for their actions\"."

      "text": "The up and down motion can fracture the ice, potentially aiding its break-up and melting, the researchers told Nature magazine. They say storm swells may have a much bigger influence on the extent of polar sea ice than previously recognised. The New Zealand-led team ran its experiments off Antarctica. They placed sensors at various distances from the edge of the pack ice, and then recorded what happened when bad weather whipped up the ocean surface. For smaller waves, less than 3m in height, the bobbing induced in the floes quickly decayed. But for waves over 3m, the disturbance sent propagating through the pack ice was sustained for up to 350km. \"At the ice edge, it's quite noisy,\" explained study lead author Alison Kohout, from New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in Christchurch. \"You have lots of waves coming from all directions with a full spectrum of frequencies. But as the waves move into the ice, this all gets cleaned up to produce one beautiful, smooth wave of constant frequency,\" she told BBC News. \"The ice floes bend with the waves, and over time you can imagine that this creates fatigue and eventually the ice will fracture. Interestingly, the fractures tend to be perpendicular to the direction of the waves, and to be of even widths.\" Computer modellers have been trying to simulate the recent trends in polar sea ice - without a great deal of success. They have failed to capture both the very rapid decline in summer ice cover in the Arctic and the small, but nonetheless significant, growth in winter ice in the Antarctic. Dr Kohout and colleagues say their experiments offer some clues - certainly in the south. When they compared observed Antarctic marine-ice edge positions from 1997 to 2009 with likely wave heights generated by the weather during that period, they found a strong link. For example, where storminess was increased, in regions like the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea, ice extent was curtailed. In contrast, where wave heights were smaller, such as in the Western Ross Sea, marine ice was seen to expand. One very noticeable aspect of the recent growth in Antarctic winter sea ice has been its high regional variability. The team says that if models take more account of wave heights then they may better capture some of this behaviour. The group did try to look for a similar relationship in storminess and ice extent in the Arctic but found there to be insufficient data to draw any firm conclusions. The geography at the poles is quite different. The Arctic is in large part an ocean enclosed by land, whereas the Antarctic is a land mass totally surrounded by ocean. Many of the ice behaviours and responses are different as a result. \"I think what's interesting for us in the Arctic is that the 'fetch' is increasing - the distance from the shores to the ice edge is increasing,\" commented Prof Julienne Stroeve from University College London and the US National Snow and Ice Data Center. \"That would allow the wind to work more"

But it said that the reason for the growth between 2006-12 was the increase in pension values over the period. And the slow rate of growth in overall wealth suggested that young people would lag behind earlier generations. Dave Innes, a research economist at the IFS and an author of the report said: \"Despite the financial crisis, household wealth on average increased in real terms over the late 2000s, driven by increases in private pension entitlements.\" Households aged between 45-54 saw the biggest increases in their pension wealth which rose on average by \u00c2\u00a338,000 over the period. Mr Innes added: \"Even with these increases in average wealth, working-age households are at risk of being less wealthy at each age than those born a decade earlier.\" The report added that the range of experiences among the study group was vast - for example, a quarter of households aged 45-54 saw wealth fall by more than \u00c2\u00a369,000, while a quarter say their wealth increased by more than \u00c2\u00a3138,000. The study also looked at people's attitude towards saving and pensions. 30% of individuals reported saving for an unexpected expense, 23% reported saving for holidays or leisure, 15% for planned expenses, 10% for other people and only 10% to provide a retirement income. Among households aged 25-34, nearly one-quarter (24%) did not expect to receive any income from the state pension in retirement. However, one third expected it would be their largest source of income after retirement. Despite new legislation that automatically enrols workers into workplace pension schemes, nearly half (44%) did not expect to receive any income from a private pension. Rowena Crawford, a Senior Research Economist at the IFS and another author of the report, said: \"It is striking how many individuals do not expect private pensions to have a role in financing their retirement, let alone be their main source of income.\" \"It will be interesting to see how these attitudes change as auto enrolment into workplace pensions is rolled out.\""

Two other Australian players, Brandon Walkin and Isaac Frost, were also disciplined over the incident. It comes days after Australian Open junior champion Oliver Anderson was charged with match-fixing. Last year, a joint BBC/Buzzfeed investigation alleged the TIU failed to act on suspicions that 16 top-50 ranked players have been involved in match-fixing. Lindahl, 28, achieved a career-high ranking of 187 in singles before retiring in 2013. The TIU, which is responsible for policing tennis, said the offence happened at the Australian F6 Tournament in Toowoomba, Queensland. \"He was found guilty of charges of contriving or attempting to contrive the outcome of an event, and failing to co-operate with a TIU investigation,\" it said in a statement. The penalty means Lindahl will not be able to resume his international playing career or attend official tennis events for seven years, the TIU said. He had already been fined A$1,000 by a court in New South Wales last year. Walkin, 22, was handed a six-month suspension for \"passing a corrupt proposal to another party\" on behalf of Lindahl. But the 1,066-ranked player is free to compete after his penalty was suspended for six months, subject to further breaches. Frost, 28 and ranked 1,515, refused to hand over his mobile phone during the investigation. He will not be further penalised after serving a provisional suspension between October 2013 and September 2014."

The driver, named as James Mathew Bradley, 60, could face the death penalty. He says the immigrants were placed in his trailer while he was distracted. They were inside the trailer without access to air conditioning or water while outside temperatures hit 38C (100F). Police say they believe the incident is linked to people smuggling. Video footage from the store reportedly showed a number of vehicles arriving to pick up some of the survivors. Several others may have managed to escape on foot into the woods nearby. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting head Thomas Homan said more than 100 people could have been in the truck at one point. Mexico's government said it was working closely with US authorities to identify the nationalities of the victims. San Antonio is a few hours' drive from the border with Mexico, and the US immigration department is trying to establish the victims' legal status. Officials were brought to the trailer by a man who had approached an employee of the Walmart store and asked for water. San Antonio police chief William McManus said in a press briefing that the people ranged from school age to in their 30s. Local fire chief Charles Hood said the survivors had heart rates of over 130 beats per minute and were very hot to touch. The fire chief confirmed at least two of the victims were school-age children. Their condition is not clear. The US attorney for the Western District of Texas, Richard Durbin, said the people were helpless victims of \"ruthless human smugglers indifferent to the wellbeing of their fragile cargo\". Experts say people smuggling is a serious issue in southern Texas, and there have been a number of similar cases in the area just in this past month. On 7 July, US Border Patrol agents found 72 undocumented immigrants from Central American countries locked inside a trailer \"with no means of escape\". The next day 33 people were found locked inside a trailer at a checkpoint on the road to San Antonio."

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been informed of the former prime minister's death and was \"deeply saddened\". Mr Primakov was head of the Russian government for just eight months between September 1998 and May 1999. Born in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev in 1929, he was brought up in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. He studied Arabic at the Moscow Institute for Oriental Studies and went on to be a correspondent for state radio and television. After moving into politics and a stint as the chairman of the Soviet parliament between 1989 and 1990, Mr Primakov played a prominent role in negotiations with Saddam Hussein ahead of the first Gulf War. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, he was appointed head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and later foreign minister in January 1996. Then in 1998 he was appointed prime minister by then-president Boris Yeltsin, and was credited with introducing difficult reforms and a degree of stability to a country still reeling from financial crisis. In March 1999, Mr Primakov attempted to prevent Nato strikes against Yugoslavia. He famously ordered his pilot to turn around midway across the Atlantic while en route to the United States on an official visit, after learning that Washington had decided to launch the air raids. The incident became known as \"Primakov's loop\". But Mr Primakov's stint as prime minister was short lived. He was sacked in 1999 by President Boris Yeltsin, who reportedly became fearful of his rising popularity. Mr Primakov signalled his intention to run in the 2000 presidential election, but dropped out when Kremlin powerbrokers united around Vladimir Putin. In 2003, he once again travelled to Iraq and met Saddam Hussein in an attempt to prevent war, this time at Mr Putin's request. But three days later a US-led offensive began. In later life, Mr Primakov headed a business lobby group and was respected as one of Russia's leading elder statesmen."

The action by MyFerryLink workers has also caused Eurostar services to be suspended for the day, after protesters got on to the tracks. Migrant activity is reported to have increased, with people attempting to board Kent-bound lorries in France. The Foreign Office has warned travellers to keep their car doors locked in slow moving traffic heading back to the UK. A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister David Cameron said he was being \"kept updated\" on the situation. P&O Ferries said the MyFerryLink workers feared for their jobs after their ships were sold by Eurotunnel to DFDS at short notice. P&O Chief Executive Helen Deeble said the sale had taken place with neither party appearing to engage constructively with French staff. She also said her company was bearing the brunt of the disruption. DFDS said it had received confirmation on Monday that Eurotunnel had accepted its offer to buy two ferries. Carsten Jensen, senior vice-president at DFDS Seaways, said: \"I understand that this is a difficult time for MyFerryLink employees but this is not a good situation for anyone and we hope this action will end swiftly.\" Eurotunnel has not yet responded to the criticism by P&O. In Kent, cross-Channel freight traffic waiting to cross Dover has built up and Operation Stack has been brought in to close part of the M20 so lorries can queue on the motorway. Despite the strike being due to end at 20:00 local time (19:00 BST), Operation Stack will continue throughout the night and into the morning. Dover Harbour Board said the industrial action closed the Port of Calais in the early hours and all ferries to and from Dover were affected, apart from DFDS Seaways services to Dunkirk. Kent Police has said extra Dunkirk crossings have been arranged. Tensions over illegal migrants at Calais have been rising, with the deputy mayor of the town blaming the British government for the number of people trying to board lorries. Philippe Mignonet told BBC Radio Kent: \"We will block the port - as simple as that. We'll arrange to block the tunnel if nothing is done\". In response, a Home Office spokesman said: \"Law and order in and around Calais is the responsibility of the French authorities, but the UK continues to work with its French counterparts to strengthen the security of the border to stop illegal immigrants entering the UK.\" Lorry driver Chris Cary, from Rochester, said he tried to cross the Channel back to Kent early on Tuesday but then decided to attempt getting on a train instead. But he said he found the road on fire as he approached the terminal with about 500-600 trucks waiting to cross. \"I didn't cancel my booking this morning for P&O, so I've literally just come back to the port and I'm now sitting back on the lane where I was at 03:10 this morning waiting for a boat,\" he said. Freight Transport Association's (FTA) international manager, Donald Armour, said"

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) brought the prosecution against Southern Health, who run the Winchester hospital. District Judge Philip Gillibrand adjourned for sentencing in October. Paul Spencer, representing Southern Health, entered a guilty plea at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court to the offence of failing to provide safe care and treatment and failing to assess risk to patients at the unit. The court heard the patient, named in court as \"AB\", had already climbed onto the roof during an earlier stay at the unit. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting for the CQC, said Southern Health had failed to take action to prevent patients from gaining access to the low rooftop between 2010 and 2016. \"The trust was aware of that dangerous state of affairs but did nothing sufficient to stop it until late April 2016,\" he added. Judge Gillibrand said Southern Health faced an unlimited fine for the offence. He added: \"It's clearly a case of considerable public interest and concern.\" Southern Health has previously been criticised over its failure to properly investigate the deaths of hundreds of patients in its care between 2011 and 2015. The Melbury Lodge unit at the hospital treats people with severe mental health problems."

Two thirds of the 1,020 primary and secondary school teachers questioned felt morale in the profession had declined over the past five years. Schools minister Nick Gibb pledged to tackle excessive workloads. The findings of the survey are timely, because last month the five main teaching unions warned of a crisis in recruitment and retention, although the government maintains the vacancy rate has stayed stable at about 1%. The survey, undertaken with a representative sample of teachers, also suggested many were unhappy with some of the government's plans. General secretary of the NUT, Christine Blower, said: \"This survey demonstrates the combined, negative impact of the accountability agenda on teacher workload and morale. \"Teachers feel that the Department for Education's work thus far to tackle workload has been totally inadequate. \"Meanwhile, nearly one million more pupils are coming into the system over the next decade. The government's solution so far has been to build free schools, often where there are surplus places, and to allow class sizes to grow. \"Add to this a situation where teachers are leaving in droves and teacher recruitment remains low. We now have a perfect storm of crisis upon crisis in the schools system.\" She added that many teachers felt their pay had been eroded over a long period of time, and that many were missing out on the 1% pay rise because of the tightness of school budgets. Mr Gibb said teaching remained \"a hugely popular profession with the highest numbers of people joining since 2008. \"The latest figures show the number of former teachers coming back to the classroom has continued to rise year after year - from 14,720 in 2011 to 17,350 in 2014. \"While the vast majority of teachers stay in their roles for more than five years, we know unnecessary workload can detract from what matters most - teaching. \"That's why we launched the Workload Challenge and are working with the profession to understand and tackle the top issues that teachers said caused the most bureaucracy, with leading education experts taking action on key areas such as marking and lesson planning.\""

Salah al-Karib has been detained pending further investigations, while Mohammed Aallaa was released on bail. According to Houli Chemlal, the group's plans - which he had known of \"for at least two months - were scaled back when a house packed with bomb-making equipment blew up the day before. He was injured in the accidental blast that reduced the house to rubble in the town of Alcanar. The Alcanar explosion came the day before Thursday's Barcelona attack in which a van was driven at speed down the main Las Ramblas boulevard, killing 13 and injuring more than 100. Judicial sources quoted Houli Chemlal as telling the court a much bigger series of attacks had been planned. Assailants killed a total of 15 people in the van attack, the stabbing of a driver whose car was commandeered shortly afterwards, and a car attack in the resort of Cambrils hours later. Eight members of the cell are dead - two were killed in the Alcanar explosion, and six were later shot by police, including five after the Cambrils attack. The last suspect to be killed was Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, believed to be the driver of the Las Ramblas van. Wearing a fake explosives belt and armed with knives, he was shot dead by police in a vineyard west of Barcelona on Monday. The surviving suspects were moved, under high security, from Barcelona to Madrid for Tuesday's hearing. The court session, a preliminary hearing to gather evidence for a future trial, took place behind closed doors. Houli Chemlal was the first to testify, wearing hospital pyjamas. He is still being treated for his injuries from the blast in Alcanar. Oukabir, whose brother Moussa was among suspects killed after the Cambrils attack, has also given evidence to the Madrid court. According to judicial sources, he has changed his story to say that he admits renting the van used in the Las Ramblas attack but thought it was to be used for a house-move. Under earlier police interrogation, he is said to have maintained that his brother Moussa hired the van using documents stolen from him. Both have been held in jail. Two other suspects were killed in the Alcanar explosion, including Abdelbaki Es Satty, the Moroccan imam from the town of Ripoll thought to have been a radicalising influence on the suspects. The two other suspects appearing in court were: All four suspects giving evidence are reported to have testified that Es Satty was the ringleader of the group.

One of his sons, Dale Brickwood, said the family was becoming \"increasingly frustrated\" the killers had not yet been brought to justice. Police said the case was \"a priority\" they were \"committed\" to solving. Mr Brickwood was attacked when several men broke into his Lindsay Avenue home in the early hours of the morning. He was left with multiple stab wounds to the head, leg and hand. The scrap metal dealer was known to keep money in his house. His son Dale said the family was not sure how much was taken but during a Crimewatch reconstruction on 8 February police appealed for \"anyone [who has] come into contact with a large amount of old style \u00a320 and \u00a350 notes\" to come forward. His son said watches and jewellery were also taken. The offenders would have been \"covered in blood\", officers said, but despite that, no-one has been charged. Two men arrested shortly after the murder were released with no further action. Three other men remain on bail. Mr Brickwood criticised Northamptonshire Police for a lack of communication, saying: \"We seem to be finding information and giving it to them.\" The police \"don't really talk to us\", he added. Northamptonshire Police said two family liaison officers had been assigned plus a \"dedicated team of detectives\". Det Ch Insp Mick Graham, leading the investigation, said: \"I can fully understand that the family and friends of David may be frustrated. \"The investigation team share that frustration and empathise with David's family.\" He said there was \"a lot of rumour and speculation locally\", but added: \"We need the people with the critical pieces of information and evidence to come forward.\" However, the family has been left \"so demoralised\" after the recent Crimewatch appeal failed to lead to further arrests, Dale Brickwood said. \"It's disgusting.

      "text": "With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. \"When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',\" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. \"And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'\" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. \"There are some big fights out there for me,\" said Burns. \"I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. \"That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking. \"I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff."

      "text": "The call comes after the RCN collected scores of anecdotes of therapy-animals, and sometimes pets, helping recovery. Some young patients found having trained dogs accompany them to the anaesthetic room reduced their anxiety before and after surgery. The RCN is working on national advice to encourage more animal visitors. In a recent RCN survey of 750 nursing staff, 82% said animals could help patients be more physically active and 60% said they believed animals improved physical recovery. But many nurses said animals were not allowed where they worked. The main reasons behind this, according to Amanda Cheesley, who is putting together nationwide guidelines on animals in hospitals, are concerns that furry companions spread infections and other \"myths around the dangers\" of allowing animals on wards. But she says she knows of examples where hospitals allowed dogs and other animals on wards safely, making a \"remarkable difference.\" She mentioned one young cancer patient who was too scared to have a life-saving procedure in theatre. The patient finally had the treatment she needed after a therapy dog accompanied her to the anaesthetic room and stayed with her afterwards. Ms Cheesley said: \"The dog calmed her down, making it so much less traumatic for her and her parents. Ultimately it allowed the staff to do a life-saving job.\" Another example involved a man who had had a brain injury that left him with difficulty walking. After he was discharged, he found going for a walk with his pet donkey helped with his balance and, over time, he was able to walk more easily. Ms Cheesley says more trained animals could help with mobility and physiotherapy - for example, by asking patients to walk towards a dog at the end of a walkway and gradually increasing the distance. Dogs could also help divert a patient's attention - for example, if a child is scared of needles, a therapy dog could act as a distraction. To collect more evidence on the benefits and challenges of bringing animals on to wards, dog handler Lyndsey Uglow who has worked with therapy-animals in hospitals for five years, has started a research project at Southampton Children's Hospital. Together with Ms Uglow, the Humanimal Trust, infection control specialists and hospital managers, the RCN aims to put together simple rules that could work across wards, clinics and hospices. Concerns that pets might pass on infections for example, could be addressed by making sure animals do not wander from room to room or patient to patient, but are instead booked for a specific patient at a specific time. Owners would also have to ensure the animal's vaccinations were up-to-date. And handlers could clean paws with hospital-grade wipes."

So far, no petrol-powered production car has managed to hit the same speed in a comparable time. The grimsel needed only 30m (98ft) of track to reach the landmark speed. The previous record of 0-100kph in 1.779 seconds was set by a team from the University of Stuttgart last year. By comparison, the fastest production vehicle, the Porsche 918 Spyder hybrid, takes 2.2 seconds to reach the same speed. The car has been built and refined over the last year by 30 students studying at ETH Zurich (ETZ) and Lucerne's University of Applied Sciences and Arts. Almost all of car's parts have been custom built apart from its tyres, battery cells and the motor control units. In a statement, ETZ said the four-wheel drive system used by the grimsel was key to its swift acceleration. A powerful motor is mounted on each wheel and the car has a sophisticated traction control system that adjusts the performance of each one to maximise torque. The lightning-fast car weighs only 168kg (370lb) thanks to widespread use of carbon fibre in its construction. The record was set on a race track on the Dubendorf air base near Zurich. The grimsel, named after an Alpine pass. is not just a demonstration vehicle but has also been used extensively in the Formula Student race competition."

Now film producers have used the tale as a premise for new World War Two drama In the Darkest Hour. Scottish film company Burning Horseshoe Productions is behind the project. However, it will not be a faithful re-telling of the story of the soldiers' escape from enemy clutches. Stephen Don, a director with Northern Ireland-based Silver Sombrero Pictures which is also involved in the project, said it was a \"brilliant premise\" for a film. He said: \"The germ of the idea for this project came from my father who was a soldier in World War Two. \"He told me that two Scots soldiers got stuck in enemy territory and ditched their uniform in an effort to get back to their lines and avoid capture. \"Their only defence if captured was that one of the them was a fluent Gaelic speaker and would bamboozle the Nazis in a lingo which they couldn't understand.\" He added: \"I find it a brilliant premise to throw together two characters into a make or break situation.\" The soldiers' escape from the Germans in June 1940 came weeks after their Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders regiments surrendered to enemy forces. Pte Kemp's memoir charts their remarkable journey from Abbeville, in occupied northern France, to the safety of the British consulate in Spain. In it, the soldier from Ballachulish, recounts the moment a German commander pointed a revolver at each of their heads after they were taken to prisoner of war camp. When they were asked to state their nationality, Pte Kemp replied in Gaelic: \"I do not know\". When he was asked which country he was from, he said: \"Ardnamurchan\". The men were then questioned in seven other languages - and to each they replied in Gaelic, to the confusion of their captors. The memoir continued: \"Next an atlas was produced. The interpreter took us over the various countries on the continent, one by one, and when he came to the Ukraine, I quickly pointed my finger to it.\" He said the commander consulted three other officers, before saying \"Allez\" and opening the gate for the trio. \"We were free once more\", Pte Kemp wrote. The soldiers were hailed heroes on their return to Scotland but once the Nazis got wind of the story, they targeted Gaelic prisoners for harsher treatment. Their tale has been adapted for In the Darkest Hour, which features fictional soldiers Hamish McNeill, who speaks Gaelic, and his sergeant, Gordon McGregor. It will look at the pair's fraught relationship as they move from the front line in France to a Nazi interrogation room in Berlin. The film, which is still in development, is a \"high concept World War Two action drama\", said Mr Don. It has received lottery development funding from Northern Ireland Screen."

Most of those in need of help have been internally displaced following decades of conflict. Malnutrition levels in Somalia have increased over the last six months with nearly half the population affected. The number of people without enough food has increased by 300,000 since February. Somalia drought leaves children 'facing death' Peter de Clercq, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Somalia, said those providing aid were ready to \"scale up\" their response to help families struggling to find food. But he noted that funding for the Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan has reached just 32% of its target. The crisis follows poor rainfall in the south and central parts of Somalia where crop production has fallen by more than half in just six months. Farmers have also lost many of their livestock in the recent drought. Aid agencies have warned that the numbers could go higher if the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya is closed down and thousands are forced to return to Somalia where they have no homes or livelihoods. In January, aid agencies launched an appeal for more than $880m (\u00c2\u00a3680m) to alleviate the humanitarian situation in Somalia but, so far, less than half of that sum has been donated. The UN report, released on Tuesday, suggests that crop production was severely hit by insufficient rainfall and flash flooding in southern and central Somalia, \"the breadbasket of the country\". The agency said continued population displacement following decades of conflict and attacks by extremist groups such as al-Shabab was a major contributing factor. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? Al-Shabab, the Islamist militant group, has been battling the UN-backed government in Somalia for years and has carried out a string of attacks in neighbouring Kenya. The group, which is allied to al-Qaeda, has been pushed out of most of the main towns it once controlled, but it remains a potent threat."

Helen Dawes maintained she was innocent of any wrong-doing and that her role was simply to run the household. But the judge disagreed and said she was \"shutting her eyes\" to the obvious. The CPS launched the High Court action to seize Dawes' assets after he was jailed in 2005 for 24 years. But his wife fought the confiscation order claiming she was not party to her husband's activities and that she had a 50% stake in the home, valued at \u00a3177,486. She claimed her role was simply to look after the house, their son and do the cooking while Dawes ran the finances. But on Tuesday, Mr Justice Collins said: \"Mrs Dawes turned a blind eye to what was going on, not because she necessarily did not want to know, but because she took the view that her part was merely to run the home, look after her child and provide for her husband.\" He added: \"It seems to me she has been shutting her eyes to what should have been obvious.\" Dawes was estimated to have earned \u00a38,283,161 between 1997 and 2003 from drug crime and he was ordered in September 2008 to pay back \u00a3355,000. The court heard Mrs Dawes and her husband had several bank accounts with significant sums of cash passing through. The amount of money involved was far in excess of what the couple legitimately earned. Mrs Dawes has since moved in with her elderly father. Mr Justice Collins said there was no reason why their son, who is in full time education, could not find somewhere else to live now he is over 18. Dawes lost an appeal against his conviction in 2007 but maintains his innocence."

      "text": "It said in a report that cuts had not been applied equally since 2010, with local authorities in the poorest areas seeing the biggest reductions. The MPs warned further cuts could undermine councils' financial stability and threaten statutory services. Local authority funding has been cut as part of efforts to tackle the deficit. Most local authority funding in England comes from central government, with about a quarter of it raised through council tax. Public spending watchdog the National Audit Office has said that by 2016 local authority funding will have been cut in real terms by 37% since 2010. In a report on the financial sustainability of local authorities, the Public Accounts Committee said that while local authorities had responded well to cuts \"on the whole\", there were concerns over whether some councils would continue to be financially sustainable. \"This is particularly the case for authorities responsible for adult social care and children's services,\" it said. Committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP, said: \"These cuts have not hit all local authorities equally, with reductions ranging between 5% and 40%. \"Councils with the greatest spending needs - the most deprived authorities - have been receiving the largest reductions.\" The report said the Department for Communities and Local Government - which has overall responsibility for council funding - did not fully understand the impact of funding cuts. It said the department relied too much on spending data and had insufficient information on service levels, service quality and the financial sustainability of councils. \"Without at least an idea of the amount of funding required to maintain statutory services to a minimum standard, it is hard to see how the department could ensure that local authorities are able to fulfil their statutory duties,\" Mrs Hodge said. The report also questioned whether the department was providing effective enough leadership to ensure councils could change the way they deliver their services to absorb future cuts and remain financially sustainable. \"Overall, as pressure from cuts grows, so do the risks to local authorities' finances and their provision of services. \"The depth and quality of the department's insight into these issues needs to keep pace with these changes, something it has struggled so far to achieve,\" the report said. In December, ministers outlined an average funding cut of 1.8% in English councils' overall spending power, as part of the local government finance settlement for 2015-16. Some councils will face cuts of up to 6.4% - which local authority bosses said would \"push some authorities to breaking point\". The government says the funding grants settlement was \"fair for all parts of the country\". Local Government Minister Kris Hopkins said at the time that the settlement still left councillors with \"considerable total spending power\", and that many councils were seeing growth in income from business rates."

      "text": "First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced last week that the government-led task force would \"fight for a future for our steel industry\". The group will be chaired by Business Minister Fergus Ewing and bring together key representatives who will work to keep open the Dalzell plant in Motherwell and Clydebridge in Cambuslang. It is the latest in a series of task forces set up to tackle problems ranging from job losses to environmental crime and the refugee crisis. But what do they do? Who sits on them and how successful have they been? BBC Scotland's business and economy editor Douglas Fraser has heard from one veteran of these task forces who described them as \"largely useless\". This was set up at the start of October \"to support workers and communities affected by Young's Seafood's decision to reduce its operations in the town\". The move followed a decision by Sainsbury's to transfer a \u00c2\u00a3100m fish processing contract away from Young's, resulting in the loss of 650 jobs. The business minister said after its first meeting on 2 October: \"The Task Force will also consider how to support longer term sustainable employment in the wider area. \"This work will take a number of months and all members of the Task Force agreed today to collaborate closely to deliver an Economic Recovery Plan that meets the needs and aspirations of the workers, the people of Fraserburgh and surrounding communities.\" The Fraserburgh team is made up of representatives of Young's, the Usdaw union, Scottish Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland, Aberdeenshire Council, local MPs and MSPs. Also taking their place around the table are Highlands & Islands Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland, the Department of Work and Pensions, the Scottish Seafood Association, the Scottish Pelagic Processors Association and Seafood Scotland. An emergency summit was convened in Edinburgh on 11 September at which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland stood ready to take at least 1,000 new refugees \"as an immediate priority\". Represented on the task force are the Scottish and UK governments, Scottish Refugee Council, British Red Cross, Glasgow Girls, STUC, New Scots, City of Edinburgh Council, Cosla, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, the DWP and Police Scotland. Following the meeting, the Scottish government's Europe Minister Humza Yousaf said: \"It is very encouraging to hear that the majority of councils have indicated a willingness to accommodate refugees - we will now build on this positive response and ensure the appropriate support and integration services are put in place.\" Established by Richard Lochhead, Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, this was tasked with \"supporting delivery of the Scottish government's commitment to tackling environmental crime\". The task force, which presented its findings to the Scottish government in June 2013, said it had looked to \"define environmental crime, identify opportunities and priorities for preventing, tackling and deterring environmental crime, improve co-ordination between law enforcement agencies and others and make proposals for legislation, research and other measures to tackle environmental crime\". It was made up of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service,"

The council's head of neighbourhood and strategic housing, Kristine Reeves, was later sacked over the affair. The development proposals, put forward by Norwich City Council, include 60 flats and 45 houses. The report to the council says 35 of the houses and flats will be for social rent. A report to Norwich City Council's planning committee, which meets on Thursday, advises councillors to approve the plans. Elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening and nearby Goldsmith Street seven years ago after Norwich City Council agreed to redevelop the site. The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry. Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed. In February 2009, London-based architects Riches Hawley Mikhail won a competition to design a new social housing development on the site, but they were never commissioned. During that year homes on the derelict site were demolished, but the site has since remained untouched."

Wearing headscarves in public institutions was banned in the 1980s. But Turkey's Islamist-leaning President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, argues that the ban is an illiberal vestige of the past. The issue has been controversial in Turkey for many years. Secularists regard the headscarf as a symbol of religious conservatism and have accused President Erdogan of pushing an Islamist agenda, converting many public schools into religious ones as part of his pledge to raise \"a pious generation\". Over the past decade the ban has been removed for schools, universities, the civil service and in August for the police. The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Istanbul, says the secular side of Turkey now feels largely ostracised, accusing Mr Erdogan of governing just for his conservative, religious support base. The conservatives respond that they were long seen as second-class citizens and the headscarf is an expression of individual liberties. Our correspondent says that Turkey's religious-secular divide is as old as the republic itself, but is now arguably deeper than ever. Witness: Turkey's headscarf row The new rules apply to regular women military officers, non-commissioned officers and female cadets. They will be allowed to wear a headscarf under their caps or berets as long as they are the same colour as their uniforms and are not patterned, Hurriyet Daily News reported. The military's opposition to the government's move has been weakened after President Erdogan's supporters increased their authority over the armed forces following the failed 15 July coup last year. The changes will come into effect once they are published in the official gazette. Turkey has had a secular constitution with no state religion since 1920. Most people in Turkey are Sunni Muslims."

      "text": "Proposals for reform will include term limits for presidents and integrity checks for top officials, president Sepp Blatter announced. Fifa will hold an extraordinary congress to elect its new president on 26 February 2016, he added. Blatter, 79, announced he would stand down in June - just four days after being re-elected president. Blatter's resignation on 2 June followed the arrest of seven Fifa officials as part of a United States investigation that saw 14 people in total indicted on corruption charges. A second criminal case was launched by Swiss prosecutors into the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, to be held in Russia and Qatar respectively. They followed a number of scandals and corruption allegations that had tainted Fifa in recent years. In December, independent investigator Michael Garcia quit Fifa in protest at the way it handled his report into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Candidates to replace Blatter in the February election must be nominated before 26 October. Initial predictions were of a December election, as favoured by several regional football confederations. By the time of the vote, Blatter will have been in office for almost nine months from the date of his 2 June resignation speech. Media playback is not supported on this device At a news conference on Monday, he did not backtrack on his announcement to stand aside - despite appearing to suggest in June he was reconsidering - confirming: \"On 26 of February, Fifa will have a new president. I will not be a candidate for the election in 2016.\" Explaining his decision to step down, he said: \"I had to do something very special and I did it. In footballing terms I would say I kicked the ball out of the field to stop something, this is what I did on 2 June. I'm still the elected president and today I speak with you as the elected president.\" Earlier on Monday, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein - who lost to Blatter in the May election - had called for the Swiss to leave his post immediately. \"President Blatter's resignation cannot be dragged out any longer. He must leave now,\" he said. Uefa president Michel Platini has been asked by a majority of world football chiefs to stand for the post. It is thought 60-year-old Platini has yet to decide whether he will stand. But following Blatter's announcement, Platini said: \"We now have a concrete date which means we can look forward to new leadership, which will surely bring with it new ideas and new solutions. This is an exciting time for Fifa.\" Term limits for officials, central integrity checks for executive committee members and the disclosing of all salaries and payments to Fifa members will be the main focus of the reform taskforce, Blatter said - although he did not go into more detail. The set-up of the committee would be like \"10 players and a coach\", he added, with one key person - the \"coach\" - driving the process. Platini said the creation of the panel was \"an important step\"."

      "text": "At the Election Court - part of the High Court - in London, four voters alleged mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman had committed electoral fraud. Independent Mr Rahman was elected for a second term in May 2014. His lawyer said the claims were a \"mixture of unfounded and false allegations\". The group of voters wants the poll declared void and rerun. Evidence is to be outlined to Election Commissioner Richard Mawrey - a senior lawyer sitting as a judge - over a number of weeks. The group of voters mounted the challenge under the provisions of the 1983 Representation Of The People Act. Andy Erlam, who stood as a councillor on an anti-corruption ticket and is heading the group, said there were \"serious questions\" which \"need answers\". Francis Hoar, representing the group of four, told Mr Mawrey his clients were accusing Mr Rahman of election fraud. He said there had been \"personation\" - where people pretend to be someone else to cast a vote - in postal voting and at polling stations. He added people had registered themselves or others to vote at addresses at which they did not live and there had been tampering with ballot papers. Mr Hoar also alleged Mr Rahman had used \"undue influence through intimidation at polling stations\" and \"interference with voters\" - including in polling booths. The court heard one presiding officer reported there was a \"constant battle\" to stop men entering polling booths with women and telling them how to vote. He said there had been \"bribery\" through \"unlawfully diverting public funds to organisations in order corruptly to procure their political support\". Mr Hoar told Mr Mawrey that his clients aimed to call almost 100 witnesses who \"know about corruption\" and \"know about Lutfur Rahman\". Mr Mawrey told the court that, if he found allegations had been proved, he could declare the election \"void\" and rule that Mr Rahman had not been declared mayor. Allegations against returning officer John Williams have been withdrawn by lawyers for the group, the court was told. Timothy Straker QC, for Mr Williams, said it had been accepted his client had \"acted properly throughout the election\". Mr Williams said, outside court, in a statement: \"This was a hotly contested election run in challenging circumstances. \"As returning officer I am politically neutral and my only concern is to run an efficient, free and fair election.\" Duncan Penny QC, for Mr Rahman, described the petition as \"a rich and elaborate mixture of unfounded and false allegations\" and its one aim was to unseat a directly elected mayor. He told the court: \"There is little, if any evidence, of personal wrongdoing by Lutfur Rahman\" and described the group's claims as \"invention\" and \"exaggeration\". He said Mr Rahman did not want to be elected as a result of fraudulent activity and had been anxious that electoral law was observed. Mr Penny said: \"He has consistently called for anyone with suspicion of malpractice to report them and has been a public proponent of reforms to the postal voting system.\" The hearing continues."

The border was closed on Monday night, and will be each night for a month. The move has been agreed with the Colombian government. The Venezuelan government initially announced that it planned to close the 2,200km-long (1,360-mile) border every night for an indefinite period. But later the general in charge of the operation, Vladimir Padrino Lopez, clarified that the ban will be lifted after a month. The border is being closed between 22:00 local time (02:30 GMT) and 05:00 (09:30 GMT). Cargo vehicles, including vans and lorries, will be banned from crossing from Venezuela to Colombia between 18:00 (22:30 GMT) and 05:00 (09:30 GMT). Venezuela, which has the world's cheapest petrol prices, estimates 100,000 barrels of petrol are smuggled through its western border every day and sold illegally in Colombia. The 17,000-strong contingent \"will be enough to guarantee security\" along the border, said Gen Padrino Lopez. The governor of Venezuela's western state of Tachira, Jose Vielma Mora, said that regional leaders support means the measure will be effective. \"There is plenty of evidence to show that most of the smuggling is done overnight,\" he told El Universal. Dissatisfaction with the shortage of many staples, as well as rampant crime and high inflation, led thousands of people in the western Venezuelan states of Tachira and Merida to take to the streets in January. The protests quickly spread to the rest of Venezuela, which faced similar problems. The opposition blames failed left-wing policies of the past 15 years - initiated with the late president, Hugo Chavez - for the country's economic crisis. The smuggling of cheap goods from Venezuela is also seen as a major problem in Colombia. The Colombian government says it leads to a big loss in taxes and complaints of unfair competition by local businesses. The profits from are often used to finance drug gangs and left-wing guerrillas, says the BBC's Arturo Wallace in Bogota. President Nicolas Maduro discussed the measures with his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, at a summit on 1 August."

Triple J said there were \"a whole range of reasons\" behind the decision. The main one is a social media campaign, originally instigated by Buzzfeed Australia's Mark Di Stefano, to get Shake It Off on the list. Readers were encouraged to tweet #Tay4Hottest100 to get the song to appear on the countdown, which was thought to be too much of an influence. Some thought Swift's track was too commercial for the alternative music station, while others said banning the song would be seen as elitism. The list was topped by Chet Faker's Talk Is Cheap, with Peking Duk's High and Cosby Sweater by Hilltop Hoods completing the top three. Mark Ronson's Uptown Funk finished sixth on the poll, while alt-J have three songs in the top 30. Triple J pointed out that Taylor Swift wasn't played at all on the station in 2014 but would have finished ahead of all alt-J's tracks if it wasn't disqualified. Vance Joy's Riptide won the 2013 poll, which saw a more commercial top three include Lorde's Royals and Get Lucky by Daft Punk.

No such poll is taking place, but his comments come after others warned of threats to devolution in Brexit's wake. In response, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said the EU result should not be read as a vote to \"centralise\" power. During the referendum campaign Labour, which leads the Welsh Government, and official opposition Plaid Cymru campaigned to stay in the European Union, while Mr Davies campaigned for Leave. Leave won in Wales, and since the June vote First Minister Carwyn Jones has called for any future Brexit deal to be put to Britain's devolved legislatures, saying he would set up an advisory group on the issue. Mr Davies said there was \"no great warmth or affection\" towards the assembly. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme, he added: \"This thought came to me when I was having an innocent conversation with a fellow farmer, we were talking about Brexit. \"He posed the question to me that if the referendum for the assembly was re-run today, could it be won? \"If you reflect on it and the state of politics at the moment, I don't think it could be won, to be honest with you. \"The more and more you travel around Wales, and I say this with a heavy heart... sadly people feel very remote from the institution. \"While people indicate in polls they want decisions taken here in Wales, it's not necessarily through the vehicle of the National Assembly.\" Two referendums were held on Welsh devolution. The first, in 1997, established the Assembly with a victory for Yes - 50.3%.% to 49.7% - but on a turnout of 50.1%. The second in 2011, on whether the assembly should have powers to make law in areas it has jurisdiction, was also won with 63.5% of the vote but with a turnout of 35.6%. Plaid's Ms Wood said: \"Brexit provides an opportunity for the nations to take more power and responsibility from the UK. \"The referendum result shows how Westminster rule has left many communities behind. It should in no way be interpreted as a vote to centralise more power in London. \"No self-respecting country should be timid or ashamed of governing itself. It's disheartening to see such a negative attitude from some in Welsh politics.\" A spokesman for the first minister said: \"We have announced our key priorities for a future (Brexit) deal, established a new business confidence fund to help businesses through this uncertain period and we've announced the establishment of a new department in government, alongside a new external EU advisory group. \"We've met with the prime minister, chancellor, Brexit ministers and the agriculture minister - we've brought together all the devolved governments in Cardiff and summoned a special Council for Economic Renewal. We have demanded, and secured some certainty about future funding, though there is still a way to go on that. \"The narrative the Welsh Tories want to develop simply isn't borne out by the facts.\""

The attacks on 13 November left 130 people dead and more than 350 wounded. Close-circuit cameras at La Bonne Biere recorded the moment two gunmen approached the cafe and opened fire at those sitting on the terrace. Piles of flowers and candles still line the pavement where the victims died, but for the first time in three weeks on Friday a handful of customers returned to the tables and chairs outside. A banner above the entrance reads \"Je suis en terrasse\" - I am on the terrace - a message of defiance popular among Parisians in the wake of the attacks. Manager Audrey Bily thanked supporters and said the cafe would \"bounce back\". \"I would like to thank everyone who has supported us for your poems, your messages and posts that have so helped us,\" she said. \"We are going to start again, to bounce back. We have carried out some work and repainted the walls to wipe away the signs of this nightmare. \"The Bonne Biere cafe was a place where people meet and exchanged and shared. That is what we want it to be again today.\" A handwritten message on a blackboard outside the cafe offered condolences to the victims' families and thanked the emergency services at the scene that night. Paule Zlotnik, a neighboring shopkeeper, praised the cafe's decision to reopen. \"It's time they open and that we continue life as it was before,\" he said. The Casa Nostra restaurant opposite the cafe, which was also hit, remains closed. The four other cafes and restaurants targeted in the attacks as well as the nearby Bataclan concert hall, where 89 people died, are also still closed."

The teenager, who is 5ft 7in tall, with a slim build, dark hair and blue eyes, is said to need regular medication. When Scott last seen, he was wearing a navy blue Adidas tracksuit with light blue stripes down the arms and legs, a white T-shirt and navy Adidas training shoes with grey stripes. Speaking at a police news conference, Mr Diver said: \"Scotty, if you see this please get in touch. You are not in any trouble we just want you home or at least let us know you're safe. \"All the family are missing you especially me and nana and your family in Isle of Man. \"Can I ask anyone who might be helping Scott stay away from home to remember he relies on daily medication which he hasn't had for at least 10 days.\" Mr Diver added: \"Scotty, we love and miss you and want you home. \"You can contact us on the missing person's text service on 116 000 through phone or text even if you have no credit.\" Mr Diver's comments came after police made a public appeal at the weekend in a bid to trace Scott. On Saturday, one week after he went missing, officers carried out a \"stop and speak\" operation in the teenager's home town. They spoke to about 1,000 people at Clydebank's bus station, shopping centre and near Scott's home. The operation has also seen an air support unit deployed in the area along with a search team. Insp John Mullen said that anyone with information could contact police at a dedicated email address: scottdiverinquiry@scotland.pnn.police.uk He added: \"Scott is a vulnerable young boy who has just turned 16. \"His family are devastated at his disappearance and I would urge anyone who knows where he is to contact police.\""

He was also accused of sharing his personal beliefs with the children, for example telling the children they were not allowed pet dogs as they were Muslim.

Ben Arfa is a great player,\" he told the Guardian. \"But Deschamps, he has a really French name. Maybe he is the only one in France to have a truly French name.\" He went on to say: \"Ben Arfa is maybe the best player in France today. But they have some origins. I am allowed to think about that.\" Speaking to French sports newspaper L'Equipe, Deschamps' lawyer called the remarks \"unacceptable, slanderous and defamatory\" and said his client would sue. Benzema's failure to qualify comes after he was issued a domestic ban for his involvement in an alleged blackmail scandal over a sex tape. France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls said publicly before the selection that the Real Madrid striker \"has no place\" in the team. Ben Arfa, who plays for Nice and previously played for Newcastle and Hull, is among the reserves for the tournament so could still be called up to cover for injury. Noel Le Graet, the head of the French Football Federation, called Cantona's allegation \"ridiculous.\" Cantona and Deschamps, who are former France teammates, have fallen out numerous times since they played together in the mid-1990s. Cantona has previously called Deschamps a \"muppet\" and a \"vulgar water carrier\", a football insult implying Deschamps was good only to pass the ball to others. Cantona was dropped from the French national team in 1995 after he attacked a fan during a Manchester United game with a kung fu-style kick. He never played for France again."

      "text": "As Mark Carney said, London is \"effectively, the investment banker for Europe\" and the City is the financial capital of the European Union. Nearly 80% of foreign exchange trading and 30% of all bank lending in the EU flows through the UK. How much that will change after Britain leaves the European Union is a matter of increasingly tense debate. In the UK, very senior figures within the financial services sector argue that it is \"nonsensical\" to argue that after Brexit, large amounts of euro-denominated trading should move on to the continent. They point out that significant amounts of dollar-trading are executed through London - and neither the EU nor the UK has a single-market agreement with the US. Many on the continent of Europe see it differently, saying that financial oversight will only be possible if euro-trading valued in trillions of pounds a year is put under the direct jurisdiction of European Union-based regulators. The biggest sector seen at risk is euro-denominated clearing, the billions of pounds worth of derivatives products traded every day to insure companies, for example, against interest rate changes, currency fluctuations and inflation risk. Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, told the BBC that it was a question of control. \"I believe that there is an issue of sovereignty and security of European monetary markets and therefore the majority of the clearing houses cannot remain in London,\" he told me. \"There will be movement, there will be a displacement and actually many of the financial institutions are already preparing themselves towards that.\" Many believe that if the trading moves, jobs will move as well. \"I don't see how it could be a good thing for the City,\" Mr Sapin said. \"The City will remain a large financial centre, will remain important for Europe as well as for the rest of the world. \"But the security of the monetary system is something that's of vital importance for any given country or any given groupings of countries - such as the case of the eurozone countries.\" Hundreds of billions of pounds of trades will be at stake. At the moment, the two sides - the UK and the EU - appear a long way apart."

Magda Birraux attended the Scottish Mission boarding school in Budapest, Hungary between 1933 and 1939. Ms Haining was arrested by the Nazis while looking after Jewish girls at the school and died in Auschwitz in 1944. Ms Birraux said: \"She was wonderful and looked after all of us very well, morning and night. \"She was even-tempered, tall, strict but fair and always set a good example. \"Miss Haining had a very good sense of justice and always treated the pupils (Jews and Christians) equally.\" Ms Birraux, the daughter of small business owners, enrolled as a boarder when she was 12. She said the matron was a highly competent financial manager who arranged weekend excursions for \"her\" girls for \"no extra charge\". Ms Birraux, a Hungarian-Christian, said: \"No girl was ever dismissed on account of her parents being unable to afford fees. \"Miss Haining kept uniforms which girls had outgrown and gave them to less well-off parents.\" The former pupil, who now lives in Lausanne, Switzerland and attends the Scots Kirk, said the boarding house was run independently from the school, which had 12 teachers. \"The pupils were taught secretarial skills, English, German and Hungarian,\" she recalled. \"We went skating in the winter, to gymnastics lessons, museums and to the cinema to watch films starring Deanna Durbin, Shirley Temple and Judy Garland. \"Miss Haining took us for long walks in the woods and to tearooms for tea and cookies. \"She paid for everything.\" Ms Birraux said Jewish children in Budapest were discriminated against from 1933 but the matron, who started working at the school in 1932, made sure that the girls in her charge \"were not affected\". \"She loved these girls very much and was like a second mother to them,\" she added. \"Many of them were separated from their parents and so Miss Haining wanted to give them all the love that she could.\" Ms Birraux recalled that boarders rose at 06:30 and had to bathe in cold water to save the school money. \"Lessons began at 8am and the first one was Biblical Knowledge,\" she said. \"Miss Haining always said grace before each meal. \"And when we had lunch at 12.30pm, she would examine our hands and nails before we ate to ensure they were clean.\" The Church of Scotland advised missionaries to return home from Europe during World War Two. But Ms Haining repeatedly refused and wrote: \"If these children need me in days of sunshine, how much more do they need me in days of darkness\". Ms Birraux said she remembered the day she heard a minister at the school arguing with Ms Haining over her determination to stay in Budapest. \"We had a minister called Mr Knight (Rev George AF Knight) and he lived in the house with his wife and child before the war broke out,\" she recalled. \"He told Miss Haining that he was joining the Army as a chaplain and asked her to give up her job, leave everything"

      "text": "The firm will rent voice and data capacity from two existing operators - Sprint and T-Mobile - and use existing wi-fi hotspots, rather than build new infrastructure from scratch. Initially, Project Fi will only be offered to Nexus 6 handset owners. Google Fiber, the firm's \"ultra-fast\" broadband service, is already seen as a disruptive force in the US telecoms market. It has been credited with encouraging Comcast and Time Warner Cable to offer their own customers speed boosts without higher prices. However, Fiber's roll-out involved Google buying infrastructure built by companies that had collapsed as well as laying its own fibre optic cables - giving it full control of the service. By contrast, one expert said running a mobile virtual network - which is dependent on rivals' equipment - might limit Project Fi's impact. \"The example of MVNOs in the US and elsewhere suggests that it's hard for their operators to dramatically change the industry because of their nature,\" said Ian Fogg from the IHS Technology consultancy. \"But the past isn't always a guide to the future. \"No-one would have thought that a handset manufacturer could transform the mobile industry by teaming up with one network - but that's what happened with Apple and AT&T when the iPhone launched. \"And Google itself has repeatedly shown that it is capable of changing the direction of an industry by entering it.\" Examples of existing MVNOs include Tesco Mobile, GiffGaff, Red Pocket Mobile and Virgin Mobile. Sundar Pichai, chief of Google's Android platform, first mentioned the company's plan to create a phone network in February, but provided little detail at the time. The company has now revealed that its subscribers will be automatically switched between 4G signals provided by Sprint and T-Mobile, depending on whichever is stronger at the time. They will also be able to make calls over wi-fi without having to use a special app, similar in nature to the Wi-fi Calling facility recently introduced by EE in the UK. \"As you go about your day, Project Fi automatically connects you to more than a million free, open wi-fi hotspots we've verified as fast and reliable,\" Google said on its blog. \"Once you're connected, we help secure your data through encryption. When you're not on wi-fi, we move you between whichever of our partner networks is delivering the fastest speed, so you get 4G LTE in more places.\" When alternatives are not available, users will also be able to use 3G and 2G signals. Customers will only be billed for the amount of data they actually use, rather than having an allowance that resets every month, as is typical on existing services. The way this will work is that customers will pay a $20 (\u00a313.30) monthly fee for unlimited calls and texts, an extra $10 for mobile data access while in the US and abroad, and then a further $10 for each gigabyte of data they decide to consume. \"Let's say you go with 3GB for $30 and only use 1.4GB one month. You'll get $16 back, so you only pay for what"

The article also said he had warned the PM the UK would have to pay its \"fair share\" and spend 2% of GDP on defence. In response, Number 10 said there were \"many difficult challenges\" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been \"as close a partner as the president has had\" adding that \"we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives\". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. \"It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can,\" he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on \"what went wrong\", saying: \"There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up.\" Mr Cameron, he said, became \"distracted by a range of other things\". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, \"wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure\" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention \"averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict\". But he added: \"And despite all that, Libya is a mess.\" He also criticised what he called \"free riders\" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: \"But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game.\" Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State. In January, Mr Cameron told MPs the \"Libyan people were given the opportunity\" to build a stable democracy - and it was a matter"

Mr Burns and Alexander Porter, 48, deny attacking the paper's investigations editor in Glasgow on 23 December 2015. Mr Thomson told the court that he heard a child screaming at about 08:30 and \"it was more distressed than playful\". He said he looked out of his window and saw his neighbour, Mr Findlay, wrestling with another man on the ground. The witness said: \"I initially thought it was a burglary. I ran down the stairs and by the time I arrived there Russell was asking the gentleman certain questions.\" Mr Thomson told the jury that Mr Findlay was sitting astride the man who was on his back and struggling to get free. He said that lying nearby was a red Royal Mail jacket and delivery bag and a broken set of false teeth. The court has previously heard Mr Findlay say that his attacker claimed to be a postman who needed a signature for a parcel, before splashing a \"corrosive liquid\" on him. In court, Mr Thomson identified the man on the ground struggling with Mr Findlay as Mr Burns. Mr Thomson said that Mr Findlay told him he was an investigative reporter and someone had sent a hit on him and had thrown a substance in his face. The witness said he asked if there was anything he could do and was told by Mr Findlay to fetch water to try to wash the acid off his face. He added: \"His face, the right hand side, was starting to blister and his right eye was starting to close over and was very bloodshot.\" The neighbour told the court that he splashed two basins of water over Mr Findlay's face before ambulance staff took over. Mr Thomson was asked if he heard the man he identified as Mr Burns say anything about who had sent him, and replied: \"As he was being led away I heard the words 'Jamie boy sends his regards' or words to that effect.\" Under cross-examination Mr Thomson was asked if he heard that or had been told that by Mr Findlay and replied: \"It's my recollection that I heard it, but possibly.\" PC David Ross later told the court that when Mr Burns was searched after being detained he was wearing two pairs of gloves - one black woolly pair and below that a clear pair of vinyl gloves. Eye specialist Dr Katheravelu Ramash also gave evidence. Asked what would have happened if the liquid thrown was sulphuric acid and prompt treatment had not followed, Dr Ramash replied: \"He could have lost the eyesight in that eye.\" Mr Burns and Mr Porter deny assaulting Mr Findlay to the danger of his life by throwing sulphuric acid on his face.

In hindsight she thinks this was just 'typical teenage rebellion' that went further than most\". \"One afternoon Karen attended an environmental protest with some of her friends. It was exhilarating, fun and she felt like she was doing the 'right thing' for society.\" It goes on to describe Karen's involvement in violent environmental protests, and how she felt like \"a soldier for the environment\", before describing how she eventually became disillusioned and cut ties with the group. She struggled to \"recover\" from radical activism, but reconnected with family, found a job \"broadly in the environmental field\" and developed a \"more moderate eco-philosophy\". Environmentalists, teachers and social media users were outraged that the publication lumped together environmental protest and violent extremism. The International Association for the Study of Popular Music said it \"strongly objects to the linking of participation in the alternative music scene to radicalisation of any kind\". \"There is no reputable evidence to suggest that listening to certain types of music leads to particular political outcomes for the audience,\" it said in a statement. \"The idea that young people who like certain types of music are problems waiting to happen needs to be challenged, as it has consequences for them.\" The Green Party called on its supporters to tell Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull \"that everyday Australians who care about our incredible natural environment should be congratulated, not demonised\". Minister Michael Keenan said in a statement the first step to preventing young people being radicalised was helping schools to recognise what radicalisation is. \"The potential radicalisation of young Australians to violent extremism, including those in our schools, is something all Australian governments are deeply concerned about,\" Minister Keenan said earlier in the week. \"It is important that anyone who is in danger of becoming radicalised is put on a different path as early as possible before they harm themselves or others.\" The booklet comes amid concerns that Australia is facing an increasing domestic terror threat from people linked to or influenced by militant groups overseas. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Australia's new defence minister said the threat from groups like the so-called Islamic State (IS) was \"very serious\". \"There is absolutely no doubt that there are individuals, leaders in that organisation, who are intent upon disrupting Western democracies,\" Marise Payne said. \"I don't think that the magnitude of the threat"

Following the 2-0 friendly loss to Swansea on Saturday, Redknapp also said defender Ryan Shotton could leave if the club's valuation is met.

Wilson blamed a contaminated sample for her positive test. UK Anti-Doping chief Andy Parkinson said: \"This sends a strong message to anyone looking to dope in the UK.\" Lincolnshire sprinter Wilson tested positive for banned steroids testosterone and clenbuterol after running the 100m in 11.95 seconds at the Bedford International Games on 12 June. Wilson won the Commonwealth Games 100m trials in 2010 only to miss out on a place in the England squad due to not meeting the qualifying time She issued a statement in July calling for UK Anti-Doping, who administer drug testing in the UK, to withdraw the case and open an internal investigation to determine the cause of the contamination. However, an independent National Anti-Doping Panel upheld the European Indoor 60m semi-finalist's four-year ban. \"We have successfully argued for a four-year ban which demonstrates that UK Anti-Doping always seeks robust sanctions against athletes who look to cheat the system and betray those around them,\" Parkinson added. \"[It] gives clean athletes the confidence that we are working hard on their behalf, within the framework of the World Anti-Doping Code, to protect their right to compete in doping-free sport.\" Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador tested positive for Clenbuterol during the 2010 Tour de France, which he claimed was a result of eating contaminated beef. Clenbuterol, similar to the asthma drug salbutamol, is used to treat breathing disorders as a decongestant and bronchodilator. It causes an increase in aerobic capacity, blood pressure and oxygen transportation, and speeds the rate at which fats are burned. It is officially classified as a sympathomimetic steroid."

On Wednesday, WBA bosses said that their former champion Rigondeaux, 35, must be Frampton's next opponent. Frampton's manager Barry McGuigan has consistently ruled out the Cuban as a possible opponent for his fighter. \"He's amazing on the back foot but he's negative,\" McGuigan said of Rigondeaux, who fights Briton Jazza Dickens in Liverpool on 12 March. \"What do we gain by fighting him?\" McGuigan's view is that Rigondeaux, who was stripped of both the WBO and WBA belts last year for inactivity, brings little to the table in terms of television or fan appeal. After Rigondeaux was stripped of the title, the world governing body promoted Quigg from interim WBA super-bantamweight belt holder to champion. However, the WBA have now said that unbeaten Rigondeaux's \"impressive record and accomplishments\" mean that he must be Frampton's next opponent. The WBA said it was \"honoured\" to have Frampton as its champion, adding: \"We congratulate him on a performance that was as intelligent as it was effective.\" In spite of the WBA's directive, it is far from certain that Frampton will agree to the Rigondeaux fight, so there appears a strong possibility that the Northern Irishman may give up the WBA belt. After Frampton's win on Saturday, McGuigan said that a contest with Mexico's WBA featherweight champion Leo Santa Cruz was an \"obvious fight\". Rigondeaux has won all 16 of his professional bouts."

We just have to make sure that we get that presence right. \"It is probably not right as it is and we need to work with all the stakeholders to improve that. \"It is extremely important that we 'do London' and 'do London' well in terms of rugby league.\" Three separate attempts to introduce a professional rugby league club in London had been made in the 1930s with London Highfield, Acton & Willesden and Streatham & Mitcham. The sport returned to the capital in 1980 when Fulham FC chairman Ernie Clay announced the formation of Fulham Rugby League Club. London's team has had four name changes since then: Games have been staged at various venues around London, with Craven Cottage, Crystal Palace Sports Centre, The Valley, Griffin Park and Twickenham Stoop among longer-term homes. Semi-professional side London Skolars were formed in 1995 while Hemel Stags join the ranks in third tier Championship One this season. London Broncos are England's sole Super League side south of Widnes while Hemel Stags, on the outskirts of London, have recently joined London Skolars among the semi-professional ranks. The numbers of people playing the game in London and the south have grown since the advent of Super League, but Sport England cut rugby league's funding by \u00a310.1 million in December. Wood is keen that the sport continues to progress in the south of the country. \"First and foremost, there needs to be a very easily understood plan,\" Wood added. \"I think it is important we pull all the strands together to come up with a credible plan that the whole of the rugby league community in London can get behind and buy into. \"Once we find that then I think the game has a chance to go from strength to strength. \"It's not any one person's problem.

The fraud took place before Lloyds Banking Group took ownership of HBOS. \"Customer cases will be considered afresh in light of all relevant evidence including new evidence that emerged during the trial,\" said a Lloyds statement. \"Since the investigation began in 2010, it was important that the group did not do or say anything that could subsequently prejudice the trial. \"The group deeply regrets that the criminal actions have caused such distress for a number of HBOS business customers.\" Former HBOS manager found guilty of corruption and fraud HBOS: A highly unusual fraud case HBOS fraud: \"They caused me to give birth early\" Ex-HBOS banker \"sold his soul for swag\" The statement explained that Lloyds would appoint an independent third party as part of the review and would agree the individual outcomes with it. It added: \"Lloyds Banking Group will contact all those customers they have identified as potentially affected by the criminal activities and provide redress if appropriate. \"Whilst this should result in all these customers being contacted proactively, any customer who believes they may have been affected can also raise concerns direct with LBG.\" Some of the victims lost their companies, livelihoods and even their homes because of the scam. Paul and Nikki Turner, from Cambridge, tried to report what was going on after their publishing company, Zenith, was run into the ground by the scammers.

Ms Dove lost millions through her nappy service firm as a result of the fraud. \"It would have been far better for the bank to admit a fraud had occurred, accept responsibility and then negotiate with the victims rather than appoint a needless third party consultant which will incur more expense, borne by LBG's shareholders and will possibly lead to extensive delays in agreeing compensation.\""

That prompted calls from Scottish and Welsh airports for similar treatment. The UK Treasury said it had not ruled out devolving APD to Scotland and Wales in the future. A report published following a consultation on reform of APD said the government at Westminster would \"continue to explore the feasibility and likely effects of devolution to Scotland and Wales\". Earlier this year Chancellor George Osborne announced the duty would be cut for direct long-haul routes from Northern Ireland airports, and he would devolve control over the tax to the Northern Irish Assembly. The move came in response to fears that some routes could be scrapped due to competition from Irish airports where APD is much lower. Commenting on the UK Government's decision not to grant the Scottish government similar powers for now, Jim O'Sullivan, managing director of Edinburgh Airport, said: \"APD is already costing Scotland passengers and having an impact on tourism revenues. \"We know from discussions with our airline partners that it is a major factor in their decision to connect further routes to Scotland. \"We would urge the Westminster Government to see Scotland as it does Northern Ireland and understand the need to both reduce and devolve this unfair and damaging tax.\" Amanda McMillan, managing director of Glasgow Airport, said: \"On the question of devolution of APD, Glasgow Airport has always been supportive of this proposal given the Scottish government's more progressive approach to aviation and its greater appreciation of the role the industry plays in supporting the growth of the Scottish economy.\" Scottish Transport Minister, Keith Brown said the case for devolving APD was \"compelling\" and had been backed by all four of Scotland's biggest airports, and recommended by the Calman Commission. He added: \"We need to be able to deal with the competitive and connectivity disadvantages that Scotland faces and if APD were devolved now we could provide the means to incentivise airlines to provide new direct international connections to Scotland, benefiting our aviation industry and our passengers and supporting the growth of the Scottish economy. \"The UK government needs to listen to the many voices in Scotland who clearly want to see full devolution of the policy on APD.\""

Passenger Rowan Fitzgerald, seven, died when the bus crashed into Sainsbury's on Trinity Street on Saturday. Pedestrian Dora Hancox, in her 70s and from Nuneaton, was also killed. Mr Chander has not been arrested in connection with the crash. When the crash happened Rowan, of Leamington Spa, was on the upper deck with his grandparents and his cousin, an eight-year-old girl, who was seriously hurt. She remains in a stable condition at Birmingham Children's Hospital. Five other people required hospital treatment. A statement issued by unnamed relatives of Mr Chander said: \"Being a grandfather himself, he is devastated to the core by what has happened. \"He is a very quiet man, and a caring and devoted person. He has strong ties with the local community and has spent most of his life helping and thinking of others.\" The relatives said they would \"only ask that the privacy of the families is respected at this tragic time\" and the police \"are given space to complete their investigation\". \"We want to express our deepest and most sincere condolences to those involved, particularly the families who have lost their loved ones,\" it concluded. A friend of the driver, Baldev Singh Sandhar, said: \"He is such a good character. He always helps people. He never likes to see any people suffering from anything.\" A former colleague of Mr Chander, who was mayor in 2008, said he had been left \"deeply traumatised\". Rowan was a pupil at St Anthony's Catholic Primary School where pupils are being supported by staff. Head teacher Jane McSharry said he was \"the most beautiful little soul\". She said: \"Rowan was a perfect, kind, unassuming, gorgeous little boy, with a smile to melt any heart. \"He loved to learn, but he also loved to play. So he loved his sport, he loved his football.\" Insp Paul Bennett said as the families of Rowan and Ms Hancox \"struggle to come to terms with their loss, they have chosen at this time not to release any images of their loved ones or to provide any words of tribute\". \"They have also asked for the media to respect their privacy as they grieve.\" The bus company, Stagecoach Midlands, said: \"No driver we employ is allowed behind the wheel of our buses without us being satisfied that they are fully qualified, safe and meet all necessary legal requirements.

Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to make a key speech on the UK's role in Europe on 22 January. He has not yet given details about the speech, but there is speculation that he will propose a referendum, to be held after the UK election in 2015. Referring to the Conservative ambition to repatriate various powers from Brussels, Mr Ashworth said \"an evolutionary solution\" was the way to proceed, not \"the nuclear option\" of withdrawal. He warned that strident Euroscepticism was giving the impression of a Britain \"snarling like a pitbull across the Channel\". He went on to say that a lot of nations were on the UK's side, including Sweden, Finland and Denmark. In recent days senior politicians in the US and Germany have warned against Britain leaving the EU. But Chancellor Osborne did not rule out a British exit in an interview with Germany's Die Welt newspaper on Friday. \"I very much hope that Britain remains a member of the EU,\" he said. \"But in order that we can remain in the European Union, the EU must change. \"The British people are very disappointed with the EU and people have the feeling that too many decisions are made too far away in Brussels. Our citizens are asking themselves if Europe can really solve their most pressing problems and create jobs and prosperity.\" Mr Cameron's coalition government is now studying areas of EU legislation where the UK may be able to claw back powers. One of its chief concerns is to ease the regulatory burden on small businesses, especially the Working Time Directive and other EU labour and welfare legislation. The government is also considering activating a clause in the Lisbon Treaty that allows the UK to opt out of areas of EU justice and policing next year. Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom is involved in that review, called the Fresh Start project. Speaking in Friday's debate, organised by the pro-EU lobby group Business for New Europe, she said the UK \"needs to be at the heart of the EU\", but also \"needs to articulate a new relationship\" with its EU partners. She said it would be feasible to negotiate a new \"multilateral\" arrangement on justice and policing with the rest of the EU, though conceded that it could be difficult. A leading Conservative Eurosceptic MP, Bill Cash, told the debate participants that \"the people don't know what they've got in terms of legislation\" from the EU. \"There hasn't been a focused debate on the pros and cons [of EU membership] since 1975.\" He said even the widely praised EU single market was \"not working, because new things have been added, increasing the burdens on business\". In the debate former Labour Party leader Lord Kinnock attacked the"

Lawyers believe the crematorium breached the Human Rights Act. The council said it was liaising with its insurers. A spokesman for the authority said: \"Shropshire Council confirms it has received a letter of notification in respect of Emstrey Crematorium and this has been passed to the council's insurers, who will deal with the matter confidentially in the usual way.\" If the legal challenge is successful, it could pave the way for action against crematoriums across the UK where other families were not given their child's ashes. A Freedom of Information inquiry by the BBC last year found the ashes of more than 1,000 babies were not handed to their parents between 2008 and 2013. The scandal in Shropshire came to light following a BBC Radio Shropshire investigation. The lawyers are representing families who have joined the campaign group Action for Ashes. In June, an independent inquiry into what happened in Shropshire ruled a national inspector should be created for crematoriums."

The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was \u00a365.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to \u00a351.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: \"It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. \"And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go.\" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have \"a huge impact\". \"What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,\" she said. \"It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations.\" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a \"key role\" in a healthy Scotland and that \"significant\" investment would continue in those areas. \"Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,\" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. \"There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested \u00a3168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.\""

De Gea, 24, won United's player of the year award last season. \"Nobody is happy to be number two and Victor has to have ambition to beat David De Gea - but it shall be very hard for him,\" said Van Gaal. Valdes had been training at United as he recovered from a serious knee injury. De Gea has 18 months remaining on his present deal with United after signing for the club in 2011, but he has recently been linked with a move to Real Madrid. However, the United boss says he will extend the player's terms with the club rather than succeed the 33-year-old Iker Casillas at Real. When asked if he thought De Gea would stay, Van Gaal said: \"I think so, yes. There is no problem for him to sign.\" The Dutchman also does not see an issue with having two full Spain internationals in his squad fighting for one position. \"My ambition is that I have the best players who can collaborate with each other to form the best team in the world,\" he said. \"When we invited Victor in to have his rehabilitation at Manchester United, we did it for him and ourselves, so I could see if his quality is also still the same. He has confirmed both.\" Valdes' arrival on a full-time basis is likely to mean the exit of previous back-up goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard. Unbeaten in 11 games, United play Southampton with their manager able to pick from a virtually fully fit squad for the first time this season. \"We only have one player injured. Can you believe it?\" said Van Gaal. \"I have to select, for the first time in my career at Manchester United, the 11 players and the 18.\" Van Gaal confirmed England winger Ashley Young would be missing for between four and six weeks with a hamstring injury."

The council said there were currently 179 takeaways within 400m of a school. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said it was simplistic to treat all fast food restaurants in the same way. The restrictions will be used as guidance when the planning committee considers new planning applications. Councillor Jane Chitty said Medway's public health and children's services were extremely concerned about obesity. \"Allowing the planning committee to take this guidance into account is a positive step,\" she said. Local authority health profile figures show 30% of adults in Medway are obese, while the average for England is 24.2% and the wider South East 23.7%. Among children in Medway, 20% of 10-year-olds are obese. \"To do nothing is not an option,\" said Councillor David Brake. \"We are already seeing the effect obesity has on our National Health Service and anything we can do to prevent this at an early age is welcome.\" A secondary and grammar school that responded to a six-week consultation on the restrictions supported the restrictions. But the Kent Small Business Federation has called them draconian and said obesity needed to be tackled by changing behaviour. The BRC said local authorities should encourage companies that wanted to play a positive role in public health and target those that were less responsible. \"There are those that are working positively to cut obesity by removing fats and sugars from food and giving clear calorie labelling on their menu boards to help customers make healthier choices,\" said director of food and sustainability Andrew Opie."

These technologies hold massive potential for young people both in and out of school. Schools are getting interested in this \"rapid prototyping\" technology. But there are still the usual barriers - access, funding, teacher awareness and confidence. However, many learners are getting 3D design whether or not their schools are ready. One of the most illuminating advocates is a 14-year-old schoolgirl from Manchester in the UK. Amy Mather won the European Commission's first European Digital Girl of the Year Award last year. The schoolgirl has presented her ideas in front of expert audiences, including Campus Party at London's O2 Arena, Wired Next Generation and the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts (RSA). Amy got involved in coding and later 3D design after attending the Manchester Science Festival when she was 11. But the key inspiration for her work has been what is loosely termed the \"digital maker\" movement, a global drive to encourage young people to be creative with technology. This includes support from Fab Lab in Manchester. \"Fab lab\" stands for a \"fabrication laboratory\", where digital ideas are turned into products and prototypes. The Fab Lab holds open days for the public and these allowed Amy to use software and hardware not available in her school, such as 3D printers and laser cutters. She uses 3D design and manufacturing techniques for her school GCSE product design coursework. \"There are people always on hand with experience, people who live and breathe it,\" she says. \"And there is a great community spirit so it's really, really easy to learn there and to go at your own pace and experiment.\" Manchester's Fab Lab was the first of nine in the UK, with the number expected to rise to 30 within three years. They are part of a global project which started in the US, growing from a university course, \"How To Make (Almost) Anything\", created by Professor Neil Gershenfeld, director of the Centre for Bits and Atoms at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US. Within eight years of publishing his seminal book, Fab: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop - from Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication, there are now around 200 Fab Labs in more than 40 countries. Prof Gershenfeld's view is that the digital revolution has already happened and that we are in process of seeing it put into practice. The challenge for Fab Labs, he says, is to harness the \"inventive power of the world\" and to apply it to \"design and produce solutions to local problems\". The Fab Labs serve both education and business as places where interested parties can come together to work with the technology. And Prof Gershenfeld is vocal in resisting the media's hyping of 3D printing. Amy Mather reflects that \"get on with it\" attitude. It's also a phrase that comes up regularly in conversation with her. She's also not the kind of person to wait until she can get"

But having won a battle with his centre-right party, what now are Mr Fillon's chances in the fight for the Elysee Palace? He will have his work cut out if he is to claw back the lead he once held in France's presidential race. The latest opinion poll on Tuesday placed him third, on 19%, several points behind centrist Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front. Mr Fillon has stuck fast to his hard-core base for the past six weeks, as an investigation into his wife's employment whipped up a storm around his campaign. As centrist supporters deserted him in droves, he barely blinked. When his campaign manager and senior spokesman quit, Mr Fillon brushed it aside. When dozens of MPs deserted him, he retorted that he would do without them all. When polls suggested that he would struggle to reach the second round run-off, Mr Fillon ploughed on, determined to show that he retained the support of his most loyal followers. In that sense, his management of the scandal seems to have been a success. Tens of thousands of people turned out in the rain to rally around him on Sunday. But his handling of the allegations against him, and the media attention surrounding them, have also marked a sharp change in tone for France's most establishment presidential candidate, with new tactics borrowed from the populist playbook. Sunday's rally was initially described by Mr Fillon as a protest against political interference in the judiciary. He has complained of an \"institutional coup d'etat\", suggesting that the Socialist government is behind the allegations currently being investigated. At press conferences recently he has presented himself as the victim a \"political assassination\", of a \"lynching\" by the media, and he has accused investigators of leaking only one side of the evidence in his case. Mr Fillon has said he will leave it up to the voters to judge him, not a \"biased [judicial] process\". But attacking the nation's institutions while running for office has not gone down well with some party colleagues. Former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, on French radio, called it \"dangerous\" and \"irresponsible\". The man Mr Fillon beat to become Republican candidate, Alain Juppe, accused him of leading the campaign into an impasse. \"He had a wide open road before him,\" he said. \"What a waste.\" There was a sceptical response, too, to the claim by Mr Fillon's team that Sunday's rally had drawn 200,000 people to the Trocadero in Paris. Several journalists remarked that the plaza only held around 35,000 people when full. The claim of 200,000 is still prominently featured on Mr Fillon's campaign website. There is now talk of a \"Trumpisation\" of the centre-right candidate, with several commentators and news outlets comparing him to the US president. It is a very different side of a politician many saw as calm, unruffled and rather"

The resolution is the latest in a series of attempts by the opposition to oust Mr Maduro from office. However, the Supreme Court is expected to declare the move unconstitutional. Even before lawmakers voted on the resolution on Monday, the Supreme Court had warned in a statement [in Spanish] that it was not in the power of the National Assembly to remove the president from office. Instead, it called on opposition lawmakers to resolve their differences with the government through dialogue. Opposition politicians and government representatives are due to meet for talks on Friday on how to solve Venezuela's economic and political crisis. The country is deeply divided into those who want to see President Maduro ousted from office and those who continue to be loyal to the \"Bolivarian Revolution\", the brand of socialism introduced by his predecessor in office, Hugo Chavez. President Maduro's critics say he, and Mr Chavez before him, are to blame for the sky-rocketing inflation and chronic shortages of basic goods the country is experiencing. Mr Maduro in turn blames Venezuela's business elite, accusing it of sabotaging the country's economy and conspiring with \"imperialist forces\" in the United States to force him from office. Previous attempts by the opposition to remove Mr Maduro from the presidency before his term comes to an end at the beginning of 2019 have so far failed. But critics of President Maduro remain adamant that a new government is needed to lift Venezuela from its economic crisis. The governing Socialist Party, meanwhile, continues to back Mr Maduro. Its vice-president, Diosdado Cabello, said on Monday: \"President Maduro has not resigned and he will not resign.\" \"He has not abandoned his post, and we have not recognized nor will we recognize a disobedient legislature,\" he added."

Guardiola has also responded to questions about a row between City and Chelsea coaching staff at Stamford Bridge following the defeat on Wednesday night. There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win. The incident centred around a disagreement between Chelsea fitness coach Paolo Bertelli and Manchester City masseur Mark Sertori, both of whom speak Italian, as the Premier League leaders celebrated their victory. Guardiola said: \"We are so polite in our defeats and we are so polite when we win. When we win, normally we celebrate a little bit, then we go to the locker room.

Atletico went ahead six minutes after the break when Fernando Torres rolled in a shot, but Neymar equalised. Messi then grabbed the winner after being set up by Luis Suarez. It was the Argentina international's 287th La Liga goal for Barcelona, extending his lead as the competition's all-time top scorer. His goal came on the day that Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo became his club's record league scorer - and moved up to fourth in the overall standings with 230 goals - by scoring five in a 6-0 win at Espanyol. Messi had scored in Argentina's 2-2 midweek draw with Mexico but was seeking his first La Liga goal of the season before Saturday's game. He saw Suarez hit the bar in a poor first half, before Atletico took the lead early in the second when Torres finished off a fine counter-attack. That lead lasted only four minutes, though, as Neymar curled in a stunning free-kick from 20 yards. Barcelona had a penalty appeal rejected when Atletico defender Diego Godin appeared to handle the ball, but Messi won the match with a stylish, low finish."

They argued he misled the electorate over a memo claiming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would rather have seen David Cameron become prime minister. Judges have ruled that there will now be a \"By Order hearing\" to discuss the next part of the case. Lady Paton and Lord Matthews had heard a preliminary legal debate at a special Election Court, which examined three questions. The first was whether section 106 of the act - which makes it illegal to make or publish false statements about any candidate during an election campaign - could apply to candidates talking about themselves, as well as attacks on their rivals. The judges have ruled that the language used in section 106 was \"wide enough to encompass a statement made by a candidate about himself\". However, they said they wanted to hear evidence about the two remaining issues before issuing a determination on the case. These are whether the words were false statements of fact which related to Mr Carmichael's personal character or conduct, and whether they were said \"for the purpose of affecting the return of any candidate at the election\". The judges said they wanted to hear evidence on these issues because each case had to be considered on its own facts. Lady Paton said: \"Circumstances can be envisaged where a false statement of fact is of such a nature that the effect in relation to a candidate's personal character or conduct transcends the political context. \"The question of the type of relationship between the statement and the personal character and conduct of the first respondent is one which requires evidence, including evidence as to the motive or reason for giving the false statement.\" Mr Carmichael's QC had asked the judges to dismiss the case, on the grounds it was \"irrelevant\" and \"bound to fail\". Legal argument was heard at a special election court in Edinburgh earlier this month, which was broadcast and streamed online live. The case is believed to be the first of its kind in Scotland for 50 years. It arose from a story in the Daily Telegraph at the start of the general election campaign in April. Mr Carmichael - Scottish Secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before the election - had authorised the leaking of a civil service memo suggesting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had told the French ambassador she wanted David Cameron to remain in Downing Street. He claimed in a TV interview the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist. However, the MP later admitted full responsibility for sanctioning its release, and accepted the \"details of the account are not correct\". The constituents who brought the petition were aided by crowd funding."

He said: \"In case you haven't heard it this is a track that stopped the internet this week. \"It didn't break the internet it stopped the internet. \"It stopped everybody to put down what they were doing and think about what this guy was saying on the track. \"Some people got offended, some people were like 'I'm glad somebody said that', other people were educated.\" The track opens with a series of samples referencing black slavery, including quotes from Django Unchained and references several cases of when the media has reported the term being used in a negative way. A sequence of lyrics, which ends with the song's title, reiterate the point Swiss made during the interview. \"It can be a term of endearment or an emotional trigger. \"It can be the difference between jovial and bitter. It depends on how it's presented, said, spoken delivered. But the expression presents a social dilemma. \"Everybody should understand the historical picture before we ever choose to use the word nigger.\" After the track was played a clip of Professor Randall Kennedy Harvard University, who teaches a course on race relations, explained the thought that some rappers put into their use of the N-word. He said: \"With hip-hop there have been some who have put great store on the spelling... because that differentiates from [the traditional spelling] which has principally been used a as racial slur.\" Following the clip Semtex added: \"I think in hip-hop it's confusing\" before playing a Y.G track and referring to a Rick Ross song which both contain heavy use of the word. He asked Swiss if hip-hop is at fault for using the word, even when it's seemingly used in an endearing way. \"I don't think hip-hop's at fault,\" replied the rapper. \"A lot of negative things are celebrated in our society. \"I think the word's got a strange journey. \"The way our language works if that it can change over time. \"It has no sort of loyalty to any gender, any race or any time period.

Residents spoke on Wednesday of a hard working, popular politician whose death had cast a long shadow. Stephen Hughes, 59, said her impact on the village would not be forgotten. \"Year after year we will have a memorial service in June to remember her. People will bring flowers, the children will be here from the schools. \"She will be remembered as a politician who put in a lot of hard work. Her heart and soul went into things, she also kept herself local despite having to go down to London.\" Mrs Cox had only represented the ethnically diverse constituency of Batley and Spen for a year before she was killed. In her maiden speech to Parliament, she said: \"While we celebrate our diversity, what surprises me time and time again as I travel around the constituency is that we have far more in common with each other than things that divide us.\" It is for this philosophy of inclusivity that those who worked closely with her say she will be remembered. Iqbal Bhana, who helped the Labour politician during her election campaign, said: \"Everyone still talks about losing someone committed and dedicated to changing people's lives. \"Her legacy is quite substantial, her 'More in Common' philosophy has become international currency which is championed around the world. \"This very simple message resonated, especially at times like these, with the current political climate. It has become much more relevant since her death.\" Tributes to the well-liked mother-of-two poured in following her brutal murder just yards from the market place. Resident Valerie Rookledge, said: \"I was away when it happened, but I came back and all the flowers were here in the square. \"It's such a quiet village, so it was a great shock. She really was trying to gather the different communities together here, and she was being successful.\" Batley councillor and friend of Mrs Cox, Shabir Pandor, said the community had been united in its grief. \"The whole community was completely devastated and in total shock, but it pulled people together. People do have to move on, but her legacy will continue. \"Her work doesn't just resonate in Batley, it resonates nationally and internationally. \"It takes a unique set of skills to be a good politician, but she didn't have to try too hard - she was as natural as the sun rising and setting.\" Revd Paul Knight, vicar of St Peter's Church in Birstall, said: \"Despite being a person of no faith, she worked tirelessly to make lives better within the faith communities. \"We want to work to make sure her legacy continues and to make lives better - and it's already happening. \"We're planning on holding a carol service this year with a focus on 'remembering'. \"She was a 21st Century Good Samaritan.\" Mr Bhana said Mair's conviction would \"close a sad chapter\" in the lives of those affected by Mrs Cox's death.

Hong Kong Police said they had detained the man and retrieved a knife from the apartment in the J Residence block ,which is situated in an affluent area and is reportedly popular with professional people working in the financial sector. Assistant district commander Wan Siu-hung told reporters that the woman whose body was in the suitcase had been dead \"for quite some time\" and had neck injuries. Speaking about the other dead woman - who had stab wounds to her neck and buttocks - he said: \"We believe the death was caused by a sharp object which cut the throat of the deceased. \"When police found her she was lying in the living room - the room was messy.\" The two women are believed to be of Asian or South East Asian origin. The South China Morning Post reported that police had found a small amount of cocaine in the apartment and that they were examining the arrested man's mobile phone. The suspect was a former employee of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, local reports also suggested. A resident of the 40-storey block, who said his fellow occupants were mainly expats, told the newspaper: \"It was a shock because you would never expect something like this to happen in Hong Kong.\" A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said: \"We can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Hong Kong. \"We are in touch with the local police and stand ready to provide consular assistance.\" Post-mortem examinations are being conducted to determine the causes of the women's deaths.

The board's explanation came after Muslim women complained about gender discrimination in divorce cases. Activists said the comments were \"patriarchal, inhuman and unjust\". The Supreme Court is hearing several petitions challenging what is known as the \"instant triple talaq\" where a Muslim man can divorce his wife in a matter of minutes by just uttering the word talaq (divorce) three times. \"Their [the All India Muslim Personal Law Board or AIMPLB] stand that 'men have greater reasoning power compared to women' smacks of a medieval mindset and prejudice against women,\" the Mumbai-based Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA - Indian Muslim Women's Movement) and the All India Democratic Women's Association said in a joint statement. \"Their justification of polygamy and triple talaq contravenes the constitution and indeed the principles of gender justice in Islam. Triple talaq is unilateral and arbitrary. Nowhere in the Islamic world is triple talaq legal. We oppose it and demand a ban on it forthwith,\" the statement added. The activists said the board should apologise to all women and ensure that their statements in the future were not derogatory to women. Muslims are India's largest minority community with a population of 155 million and their marriages and divorces are governed by the Muslim personal law, ostensibly based on the sharia. Women's groups and campaigners say the controversial practice of triple talaq is un-Koranic and must be declared unconstitutional. Most Islamic countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, have banned triple talaq, but it thrives in India, they say. Islamic scholars too say the Koran clearly spells out how to issue a divorce - it has to be spread over three months which allows a couple time for reflection and reconciliation. Campaigners say men are now increasingly using text messages, Skype, WhatsApp or Facebook to pronounce divorce. But the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) says the divorce rate is still very low among Indian Muslims and that the issue is being blown out of proportion by forces inimical to Islam."

Miss Morgan, from Lampeter, Ceredigion, said her family will get a Christmas thanks to assistance from a charity. \"I don't know where me and my children are going to be on Boxing Day but I'm trying to stay positive,\" she said. Miss Morgan and her children, who are all under six, will have Christmas dinner at Victoria Hall in the town cooked by Home Start Ceredigion, which helps people from across the region. The charity also collects donated toys, books and gifts, meaning Miss Morgan's children will have presents to open. \"The children just want Santa to come, so that's my main thing at the moment is to make sure they have a good Christmas Day. \"Then they think 'we've been good this year' because they have - they've had a really really tough year.\" Home Start Ceredigion's manager Sharon Morris said: \"We're trying to help as many families as we can because people don't realise that this kind of poverty and homelessness isn't just in cities it is going on in rural areas. \"People get into debt and it's difficult to get out of it.\" Miss Morgan said the council was not able to help until she is actually homeless and she has a viewing for another home, but it is an uncertain time. \"Me and the kids don't know where we'll be on Boxing Day - we might be sleeping outside my front door, we don't know.\" If she cannot find accommodation, Miss Morgan and her children will try and get help from a refuge in either Cardigan or Borth. Despite this, she said she is trying to be upbeat and said her family will enjoy their Christmas. \"All I want for them is to enjoy two hours out of the day where we can be a family and enjoy other people's company and not be on our own.\""

      "text": "One of them, the blogger Prof Michael Pettis of the Beijing Business School, had earned kudos as one of the first to predict the sharp slowdown in China's economy seen over the last year. The other was the Economist. The magazine, that is. Their bet - for a bottle of booze - was over whether China's economy was about to run out of puff. The country has managed 9.9% growth on average over the past 35 years, but Prof Pettis thinks that the growth rate will fall to a measly (by Chinese standards) 3% this decade. The more gung-ho Economist by contrast was forecasting that China would stay on course to overtake the US as the world's biggest economy by 2018. \"China has grown very rapidly in the last 30 years, but it has been following a model that is not unique,\" says Prof Pettis. \"In the 50s and 60s almost everyone 'knew' that the Soviet Union would overtake the US in the 70s - even Jack Kennedy - but it didn't happen. Instead, the Russian economy got mired in debt and years of stagnation.\" Other examples include the Brazilian economic \"miracle\" of the 1960s and 1970s, says Prof Pettis, that ended in a 1982 financial crisis and a \"lost decade\" of growth, or Japan's rapid ascent up until its own 1990 crisis and subsequent two-decade stagnation. What these countries have in common is an enormous level of government-led investment - in roads, trains, schools, hospitals, education and training. \"You can get tremendous growth by keeping investment levels high,\" he explains. \"And in the early days, growth is healthy and sustainable. \"But later... you very easily reach a point where you can't identify economically viable projects any more, and you overshoot and start misallocating capital in a pretty significant way. That's when debt rises more quickly than the economy's capacity to service it.\" China has been overinvesting perhaps since the 1990s, according to Prof Pettis, and certainly in the last five to 10 years. \"A lot of growth is fake,\" he says. \"If you spend $1bn building an airport, it generates the same amount of [economic output] today whether or not anyone actually uses the airport. \"If no-one uses it, however, the economic value created by the airport is not enough to repay the debt, and so future growth must decline as wealth is transferred from some other part of the economy to pay down the debt.\" He says that there are three main sources of growth for China. The first, investment, is already exhausted. The second, exports, are also no longer viable, as China's main export markets in Europe and the US are depressed, and China's trade surplus has become politically contentious in those countries. The third option is for ordinary Chinese people to increase their spending on consumer products and services. But here the numbers just don't stack up. Consumers account for just a third of spending in China - an unprecedentedly low share for any major economy - while investment accounts for a whopping half of the economy. If"

His stark warning comes a day after President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with \"fire and fury\". US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to assure Americans there was no imminent threat. In Wednesday's strongly worded statement, Mr Mattis called on Pyongyang to halt its arms programme. \"The DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons,\" the US Marine Corps general said. \"While our state department is making every effort to resolve this global threat through diplomatic means, it must be noted that the combined allied militaries now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth.\" Pyongyang's actions \"will continue to be grossly overmatched by ours and would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates\", Mr Mattis added. Mr Trump - who has said he will not allow Pyongyang to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the US - boasted earlier on Wednesday of America's atomic arsenal. In early morning tweets from New Jersey where he is on holiday, the president said the US nuclear stockpile was \"more powerful than ever before\". He added that he was hopeful \"we will never have to use this power\". End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump End of Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump The tweets come amid escalating rhetoric between the two sides. North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency said on Wednesday that Pyongyang was \"carefully examining\" a plan to strike the US territory of Guam. The Pacific island is home to US military bases, strategic bombers and about 163,000 people. Stopping in Guam to refuel after a trip to South East Asia, Mr Tillerson said he was hopeful a global \"pressure campaign\" involving Russia and China could lead to new dialogue with Pyongyang \"about a different future\". America's top diplomat also defended President Trump's language. He said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not understand diplomatic language, and a strong message was needed that he could understand. Mr Tillerson added the situation had not dramatically changed over the last few days, and that Americans \"should sleep well at night\". China has urged calm, describing the situation as \"complex and sensitive\". Anthony Zurcher, BBC senior North America reporter As Donald Trump made his \"fire and fury\" threat against North Korea, the lone camera in the room zoomed in for a tight shot. It would have been telling to see the effect those words had on his advisers. Did they nod knowingly or look surprised? Was this part of the plan or an off-the-cuff presidential remark they'd have to clean up? A day later and thousands of miles away, Rex Tillerson had out his mop and broom. The secretary of state said Mr Trump was merely reasserting that the US would defend itself if attacked, using language North Korea would understand. That's not exactly what the president said, however. He warned of retribution if Kim Jong-un continued to make"

Her friends said Ms Takahashi - who had been at the firm for less than a year - claimed to be so busy she slept just 10 hours a week. Death from overwork is relatively common in Japan, where it has its own word: karoshi. Ms Takahashi is reported to have worked 100 hours of overtime a month for some time before her death. She died on Christmas day 2015. According to reports, a note left behind for her mother included the line: \"Why do things have to be so hard?\" The Asahi Shimbun newspaper said the company was being charged over illegal overtime, and that prosecutors were seeking a fine. That would effectively end the investigation, Kyodo news agency reported. The case against Dentsu targets the corporate entity, but not any individuals. But Kyodo news agency quoted Ms Takahashi's mother as saying she was \"unconvinced\" about the lack of charges for her daughter's superiors. The high-profile case has led to renewed calls for changes to Japan's notoriously long working hours and illegal unpaid overtime. Officially, there are several hundred cases of karoshi each year, although campaigners say the real number is even higher. Dentsu has made a number of reforms in the aftermath of Ms Takahashi's case, reported to include turning off the lights at 22:00 every night in a bid to force employees to leave. The agency's chief executive, Tadashi Ishii, offered his resignation last December over the controversy."

      "text": "The Liverpool singer, whose 1987 single Wonderful Life was a top 10 hit around the world, suffered head injuries in the crash in Ireland on 10 January, and was placed in an induced coma. He died on Tuesday surrounded by his family in hospital, his publicist said. His wife Camilla said she was \"deeply grateful\" to staff who cared for him. The father-of-three, who was in intensive care at Cork University Hospital, \"died peacefully\" with his family at his side \"who were singing him on his way\", a statement said. \"Colin received the best possible care from the expert and highly professional staff there and we are deeply grateful for everything they did,\" his wife and three sons said in a statement. Fellow Liverpool musician Pete Wylie of 80s band The Mighty Wah! paid tribute to his friend on Twitter, saying the news was \"just so very sad\". \"I want to send all the love I can muster to Colin's parents, brother & partner + to all who loved him, and who he loved too,\" he wrote. \"I could still sing the very first song Colin recorded with me in the WAH! studio. I remember it that clearly. And that voice!\" Born in Liverpool in 1962, Vearncombe had his first top 10 hit with the single Sweetest Smile in June 1987 when he was 25 years old. His second hit song Wonderful Life, which he had previously released but only got to number 72 in the charts, made the top 10 in the UK, Switzerland, Germany, France, Austria, the Netherlands and Italy. However, despite having found fame, Vearncombe later said \"the pop star life\" was not as he had imagined it. \"I was frustrated by how few of the people in the music world I respected. Maybe I just didn't go to the right clubs. I've never been a great schmoozer or networker and the idea of setting out to meet a certain type of people is anathema to me,\" he said. \"It was two years of disappointment - I didn't have any wild sex, I'm not a druggie, so I was just digging a hole for myself.\" Wonderful Life has since been used in numerous advertisements and films, and has been covered by artists including Tina Cousins and Katie Melua. The album of the same name sold more than 1.5 million copies and peaked at number three. Although he is best known for Wonderful Life and another 1980s single Sweetest Smile, Vearncombe released 15 albums under his own name. Last year, he returned to his original stage name for a crowd-funded album, Blind Faith, which received positive reviews. He has also published poetry and staged exhibitions of his paintings in south-west Ireland, where he lived in later life. Hundreds of fans wrote messages of support on the musician's Facebook page following the crash. His publicist said there would be a private funeral, as well as a memorial service for him in Liverpool \"as we know there are many, many people who will want to celebrate Colin's life and work\"."

Four-time Tour de France champion Froome finished in the bunch on the 198km stage from Escaldes-Engordany. The Team Sky rider, 32, still holds a two-second lead. Spain's David de la Cruz, Irishman Nicolas Roche and American Tejay van Garderen are his closest challengers. Froome is aiming to become only the third rider to win the Tour and the Vuelta in the same year. Trentin, 28, has now won a stage in all three Grand Tours, adding to victory at the 2016 Giro d'Italia and wins in the 2013 and 2014 Tours de France. \"I'm really proud to have done this with this team,\" said Trentin. \"I was really looking for this stage win as I've been going well in the last part of the season.\" Quick-Step have won two of the four stages of this year's Vuelta, following Yves Lampaert's victory on stage two. They held the race together to set up Trentin for a bunch sprint after the breakaway duo of Stephane Rossetto and Diego Rubio were caught inside the final 10km. Britain's Simon Yates moved up to 10th in the general classification, 48 seconds behind Froome, after Italy's Domenico Pozzovivo crashed late on and lost three minutes 25 seconds. Yates' twin brother and Orica-Scott team-mate Adam remains eighth overall, a further nine seconds ahead, while former winner Vincenzo Nibali of Italy still trails Froome by 10 seconds.

Their last group game is against Australia on 10 October. \"We've all celebrated in the last few days,\" said Gibbs. \"But it counts for nothing unless we win on Thursday and go unbeaten throughout this group.\" Gibbs, 44, starred for the British and Irish Lions as they beat South Africa in 1997 and also played for the Wales and Great Britain rugby league teams during a glittering career. He famously scored a last-minute try at Wembley when Wales beat England 32-21 in the 1999 Five Nations Championship. The former Ospreys and Swansea centre added: \"The nation is behind them - they just need to play smart football, conserve energy and probably put the pressure on Fiji to play rugby.\" Meanwhile, Wales centre Jamie Roberts says once-capped centre Tyler Morgan, 20, can impress on his World Cup debut after being called in to replace the injured Scott Williams. \"He was unlucky to make the squad in the first place,\" said Roberts. \"He's a very explosive player, a young guy who's very enthusiastic and he has to put that into 80 minutes. \"He's a talented fella and he'll fit straight in. \"He's got experience around him with myself and Dan [Biggar at fly-half] and George [North] and Alex [Cuthbert] as well. \"It's the same for Matthew Morgan [at full-back]. \"He comes into a backline with a lot of experience and just has to take care of his own job and the rest will happen for him.\" Roberts felt Fiji could also have beaten England in the tournament opener had a crucial moment gone their way. \"I thought they played some great stuff and when [Niko] Matawalu's try was disallowed, that was a massive, massive turning point in that game,\" said the Harlequins player. \"If they'd have scored then, I really feel they might have gone on and won it. \"I've played against quite a few of those lads in the Top 14 and they're serious rugby players and serious athletes.\" Fiji captain Akapusi Qera, 31, starred in their back row as they dumped Wales out of the 2007 tournament in Nantes. He said: \"It's the best memory ever so far in my rugby career. \"For me as a young boy coming into that big tournament and to win and get qualified for the quarter-finals, it was a major, major boost in my rugby career. \"And maybe that's why I'm still hanging around for a few a couple more years in order to replicate that history.\""

The fourth and final automatic place is between West Indies and India - and will depend on how the International Cricket Council rules on an unplayed series. With every team expected to play each other over a two-year period, a scheduled series between Pakistan and India - due to take place before the end of October - did not happen, and looks unlikely to do so for political reasons. If the six available points from that series are shared, fourth-placed West Indies would finish above India as they have recorded the most wins of the pair. The Windies would also stay fourth if Pakistan, as the home side, are awarded the points because of the Indian board's perceived reluctance to play them. The fifth-placed side will join South Africa, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and six other teams in Sri Lanka early next year, to play a final qualifier for the last four places in the World Cup."

It said GPs had voiced serious concerns over the sustainability of practices, with more than 80% worried. The Welsh Government said it was launching a major recruitment drive. Last month, the BMA said a crisis facing GP services in some parts of Wales was getting worse, as figures suggested a spike in the number of practices being handed back to health boards to manage. The BMA is launching a campaign, An urgent prescription for general practice in Wales, as the report is published. The survey was sent to all its GPs in Wales and 244, or a fifth of those asked, responded, with a relatively even response rate across the country. The BMA said it was \"confident\" the level of response would have delivered \"representative results\". Of those, 65, or 27%, said they were considering a career change and nearly 14% (13) were planning to work abroad within the next 12 months. Worries about understaffing were high up the list, with some practitioners considering reducing their working hours to cope with growing pressures. More than 60% of respondents said they did not have a good work-life balance, with 58% saying that balance had worsened over the past year. Three-quarters said the health of staff within their practice had already been negatively affected by the workload, and nearly half would not recommend a career in general practice. Dr Charlotte Jones, chairwoman of BMA Wales' GP committee (GPC) said: \"There is a significant gap between the demand placed upon general practice and its capacity. \"The profession is forced to try and cope with inadequate resources, an unsustainable workload and a workforce under considerable strain, across the whole of Wales. \"The survey findings have identified clear trends in GPs' areas of concern and highlights just how immediately action needs to be taken. GPs continue to remain committed to the profession but for it to turn around, they need the tools, resources and support of Welsh Government.\" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: \"As the BMA are aware, we will be launching a major national and international recruitment campaign at the end of October to market Wales and NHS Wales as an attractive place for doctors, including GPs and their families, to train, work and live. \"We continue to invest in primary care and will shortly be entering into discussions with GPC Wales about changes to the General Medical Services Contract.\" The report was released the same day as a conference on rural primary care is being held in Gregynog Hall, near Newtown, Powys, hosted by Montgomeryshire Medical Society, to discuss what it called a crisis in GP services in many rural parts of Wales and the UK. Dr Michael Lewis, a Welshpool GP, said: \"Recruitment campaigns have had little or no success, so together Powys Teaching Health Board and general practices are looking at new ways of providing primary care. \"This often depends on working with other healthcare professionals or new technology and has"

But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. \"We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,\" he said. \"I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. \"The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish. We knew we had to put the pressure on Pakistan and then on the last day you never know. \"We played a good game and so did Pakistan. They were a bit sloppy today and we put"

United dominated possession and had more chances than the league leaders. Mourinho said: \"We prepared for it to be like this. It was the game we wanted and expected.\" Chelsea will be champions if they win at Arsenal and Leicester in their next two matches, having beaten third-placed United with a first-half goal from Eden Hazard. Visiting manager Louis van Gaal said it was his side's \"best display of the season\" but Mourinho insists it was part of the game plan. \"It was difficult, but less than you think,\" he said. \"Control their direct football to Marouane Fellaini and control the wingers from making crosses on the inside foot. \"When we know Wayne Rooney plays in midfield, we control his progression into the box. Control set-pieces and don't give away direct free-kicks as they have three specialists. \"Wait for a mistake and score a goal. We were able to make their important players disappear. Nobody saw them. They were in our pockets.\" United went into the match knowing they needed to win for the first time in five league visits to Chelsea to have any realistic hope of winning the title. But, despite big celebrations at the end of the match, Mourinho was careful to point out his side are not champions yet. \"We are not celebrating,\" he said. \"Football is not about 'ifs' and 'almosts', it is about mathematics. When it is done, it is done, and until that moment we don't celebrate. \"The celebration is because we have beaten one of the biggest clubs in the world. The celebration is because they have everything to win that game and the result is because of the work they did all week to prepare for this game. \"I feel we are almost there but there are no 'almosts' in football.\""

      "text": "Yet in this election, it is way down the list of priorities for most political parties. Philip Hammond, himself a former defence secretary, has been reported as saying recently that \"there are no votes in defence\". He does not recognise the quote, but the sentiment is largely borne out by the opinion polls which show defence just scrapes into the top 10 of electorate concerns, way behind the economy, the NHS and immigration. UK military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya may have also contributed to a sense of combat fatigue among the public and a reticence by politicians to focus on the subject. James de Waal, a senior fellow at independent think tank Chatham House, says in this campaign, politicians have been \"on the defensive on defence\". This election issue includes foreign policy and the role of UK\u2019s defence forces at home and abroad. Policy guide: Where the parties stand To find out Labour and Conservative policies on the subject you will have to persevere to page 77 of both their manifestos. Even then they are pretty short on detail and do not really address the difficult decisions the next government is likely to face. So to help, here is a guide to some of the more sensitive issues being left out. Most analysts, and politicians, agree the world is becoming more dangerous and unstable, whether that is shown by thousands of migrants fleeing so-called failed states, the threat from Islamic extremism, or a more belligerent Russia. Yet at the same time, most European nations, including the UK, have been making significant cuts to their armed forces. The size of the UK's regular Army is being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000. You could fit that number in Wembley Stadium and still have seats to spare. The Royal Navy now has a fleet of just 19 warships, while the RAF has been left with eight - soon to be seven - front-line fast jet squadrons. There are some things the UK military can no longer do - so-called capability gaps. The UK has no Maritime Patrol Aircraft. It has to rely on its Nato allies to hunt for Russian submarines near or in its waters. At the start of the last parliament, David Cameron could boast that the UK was the fourth biggest spender on defence in the world. Now, according to the Stockholm International Research Institute, the UK has fallen to sixth place, behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and France. A commitment to spend 2% of the nation's wealth, or GDP, on defence is conspicuous by its absence. Only two smaller parties - UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party - say they would continue to meet that goal. But all the indications suggest the UK will soon fall below the Nato threshold. Malcolm Chalmers, of the defence think tank Royal United Services Institute, says on current projections, UK defence spending will fall to 1.7% by the end of the decade. If there are more cuts it could fall to 1.5%. He calculates that defence would require another \u00a325bn over"

Oil-rich Venezuela has been hit hard by the global drop in oil prices and suffers from high inflation and a chronic shortage of basic goods. Several airline companies have said that currency controls in Venezuela made it impossible for airlines to convert their earnings into dollars and send the money abroad. In a statement, Latam airlines said it would suspend its operations to Caracas airport \"temporarily and for an unspecified time\". It said flights on its Sao Paulo to Caracas route would end first, within days, and the other routes it runs to Caracas from Lima and Santiago would be halted by the end of July. Strict currency controls were first imposed in Venezuela in 2003 by late President Hugo Chavez. The restrictions were further tightened two years ago, forcing several airlines to reduce their operations in the country as they struggled to repatriate billions of dollars in revenue held in the local currency - the bolivar. Some airlines are now requiring passengers to pay their fares in dollars. Venezuela's government says it is using its foreign reserves - which are now scarce - to pay for essential items such as medicines and industrial machinery. Recently Coca-Cola said it would be halting production of some of its soft drinks because of a lack of sugar while the tyre and rubber products company Bridgestone also ended its more than 60-year relationship with the country."

Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far.\" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: \"Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BOOM! \"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BLAM! BORN TO RUN!\" It led to the memorable headline: \"America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch\" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year. You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX. She raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into"

Its report, which will be voted on next month, said the \"ongoing loss-making position\" was a \"cumulative result of a number of key factors\". Cabernet Ltd, the holding company for Aurigny Air Services and Anglo Normandy Engineering, operates through borrowing guaranteed by the States. The debt to be written off is \u00a319.9m accumulated from 2003 to 2014 and the expected \u00a35.3m loss up to 2017 - \u00a32.3m in 2015, \u00a31.5m in 2016 and \u00a31.5m in 2017.

Mr Luciw's family said retired people should undergo regular driving tests. Age UK said it was \"vital\" older people could drive for as long as possible. The family described Mr Luciw, the father of a baby girl, as generous, kind-hearted and a lover of practical jokes. \"He had only just turned 27 and he had his whole life ahead of him,\" said his mum Andrea Shelton. \"He was looking forward to his baby's first crawl. Now he will miss all of her life through no fault of his own.\" \"It doesn't feel as if we have lost him - it feels as if he has been taken away from us,\" said Mr Luciw's brother Simon. \"There are so many things that should be put in place so things like this could be avoided. People are driving that shouldn't be on the road. \"The older you get, the more your reactions slow down. \"There needs to be some sort of test introduced, in a car with a driving instructor, so you get a true reflection of how good a driver you are. \"You get a free bus pass once you are in your 60s so people can't say they are going to lose their freedom if they have their licence removed.\" Mrs Shelton said Mr Luciw, a delivery driver, was on a long-distance journey with a colleague Andy Harrington when the crash happened at 02:00 GMT on 12 October near Kegworth, Leicestershire. Mr Newman's car was heading north on the southbound carriageway. Mr Harrington, who was driving the Ford Transit, said he had not seen Mr Newman's car until the last second. \"I managed to swerve slightly towards the crash barrier but there was nothing I could do,\" he said. \"You couldn't even blink that fast. \"It lives with me.

It's not something I will ever forget.\" Mr Harrington, who sustained serious injuries in the crash, said retired drivers should have to undergo medical examinations. \"It's up to the government whether they listen to us,\" he said. \"But if that driver hadn't been on the road that morning, Michael would still be here with his daughter.\" Currently drivers over 70 in the UK must fill in a self-assessment form every three years to renew their licences. The form does not include a medical or driving test. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) which maintains the database of registered drivers said it had no plans to restrict licensing on the basis of age. \"Evidence does not show that older drivers are more likely to cause a serious accident than others,\" it said. \"The rules are clear that all drivers over 70 have to renew their licence every three years and have to tell DVLA about any medical conditions which might affect their driving. \"If we find evidence a driver does not meet the appropriate medical"

The scheme was set up several years ago to encourage domestic and business users to change to biomass heating systems, mostly wood pellets. Industry Minister Jonathan Bell announced on Friday his intention to close it to new applications. On Tuesday, officials told the enterprise committee that \u00a330m would have to come out of the block grant in 2016/7 to pay for it. The renewable heat incentive scheme applies to both home and business users. Businesses get about \u00a324,000 a year over a 20-year term for installing one of the renewable heat systems. The benefits to domestic applicants are less lucrative, with an upfront payment of about \u00a33,500 and \u00a31,200 a year for seven years. Mr Bell told the assembly that the chancellor had limited the amount of money being paid to Northern Ireland out of the UK pot for renewable heat, and that had led to the problem. He said the scheme had been oversubscribed and it had created a \"huge budgetary pressure\" not just for his department, but for the whole of Northern Ireland. Dr Andrew McCormick, the Department of Enterprises's permanent secretary, said there had been a need to \"turn the tap off\" as quickly as possible to contain the overspend. He said it produced a \"very serious financial issue\" and it was the minister's \"judgement that it was necessary to suspend the scheme immediately to prevent that overspend becoming even worse\". The committee was told that \"whistle-blower allegations\" had been received through the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister. These have been drawn to the attention of the regulator Ofgem, which administers the scheme across the UK. Treasury funds covered the scheme up to a certain level, but due to the spike in applications at the end of last year, there was a large funding gap which would have to be covered from the Stormont budget. Nine hundred applications had been received over three years. In a six-week period last Autumn, a further 900 applications flooded in. Dr McCormick said with the scheme closed to new entrants, the funding gap would reduce in future years, but would still be \u00a311m by 2021. Committee chair Patsy McGlone said the sudden closure of the scheme would threaten jobs and businesses. He said one installation company believed it could cost it up to \u00a31m and put 25 jobs at risk. The Ulster Farmers Union told the committee that 50 poultry projects could be at risk as a result of the scheme's closure."

The White House said businesses had pledged $150m (\u00c2\u00a389m) to promote it. The president said it was an \"outrage\" that black and Hispanic men in the US fared so much worse than white men. \"I believe the continuing struggles of so many boys and young men - the fact that too many of them are falling by the wayside, dropping out, unemployed, involved in negative behaviour, going to jail, being profiled - this is a moral issue for our country,\" Mr Obama said at the White House on Thursday, with more than a dozen black and Hispanic young men and boys standing behind him. \"It's also an economic issue for our country.\" In a memorandum released on Thursday, the White House said the task force would focus on issues facing boys and young minority men under the age of 25. America's first black president has generally avoided policies defined by race, the BBC's Beth McLeod reports from Washington DC, but in an emotional speech Mr Obama said it was an outrage that young Hispanic and African-American men have the odds stacked against them in US society. President Obama said young men from this group were more likely to have no father in the house, end up behind bars, or become victims of violent crime. The White House has cited the relatively high unemployment rate for black and Hispanic men over the age of 20 and a higher-than-national-average poverty rate for minority households. \"We've become numb to these statistics, we're not surprised by them, we take them as the norm,\" Mr Obama said. \"We just assume this is an inevitable part of American life, instead of the outrage that it is. \"But these statistics should break our hearts. And they should compel us to act.\" He spoke of visiting a school near his home in Chicago and sharing with the boys there his own experience of growing up without a father, acknowledging to them that he had been angry about that and had made \"bad choices\" and \"got high without always thinking about the harm that it could do\". \"I could see myself in these young men,\" Mr Obama told the audience at the White House. \"And the only difference is that I grew up in an environment that was a little bit more forgiving, so when I made a mistake the consequences were not as severe.\" Mr Obama's new initiative calls for foundations and community groups to co-ordinate investment in support programmes to keep young Hispanic and black men in school and away from crime. A public online portal called What Works will provide access to data about such programmes. To start the programme, a new federal task force will look at several issues affecting young men. These include access to childhood support, grade school literacy, pathways to university and careers, as well as interactions with the criminal justice system and violent crime.

      "text": "Former Swans striker Wilfried Bony scored his first goal for Stoke before Wayne Routledge headed the visitors level in a frenetic first half in which the hosts hit the post three times. The volume of Stoke chances eventually told as visiting defender Alfie Mawson turned Ramadan Sobhi's shot into his own net, and Bony then nodded in a third after Joe Allen's shot was saved. Mark Hughes' side are now 12th in the table while Swansea, despite some initial signs of improvement, remain second from bottom and five points from safety. It was a galling evening for the visitors, who had the chance to re-sign midfielder Allen from Liverpool in the summer. Instead it is with Stoke he is enjoying the most prolific season of his career, his two assists here adding to the four goals he had scored in his previous four appearances for the club. A fifth match unbeaten represents an impressive transformation from Stoke, whose dismal start to the season had left them at the foot of the table after five games. One thing missing from Stoke's revival had been a goal for Bony, so there was a sense of fate to the way the striker on loan from Manchester City put the Potters ahead against his former club. Allen provided the assist with a half-volley from a half-cleared corner - an example of the visitors' ragged defending that was symptomatic of a frantic start to the game. Bob Bradley's side were overrun by their dominant opponents, for whom Charlie Adam twice hit the post with shots from outside the penalty area. Marko Arnautovic did the same after rounding Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, but the visitors' narrow escapes merely felt like delaying the inevitable. Stoke's pressure was unrelenting and, after substitute Ramadan wriggled past Swansea's hesitant defenders and forced Mawson into an own goal, it was left to Bony to nod in from close range after more good work from Allen to seal victory and score against Swansea for a second successive season. Allen's performance saw him provide two assists in a Premier League game for the first time, while Bony scored for the first time since Boxing Day, having gone 23 games for club and country without a goal. Swansea's slump of nine matches without victory is their worst since their 2011 promotion to the Premier League. There were hints of improvement in Bradley's first two games in charge, a 3-2 defeat at Arsenal and a goalless draw at home to Watford. He will also have been encouraged by his team's initially spirited response to the relentless Stoke pressure - but Swansea's defects remain. They were porous in defence and weak in midfield, where Ki Sung-yueng and Leroy Fer offered precious little resistance against their vibrant opponents. Lone striker Fernando Llorente led the line willingly enough but he and substitute Borja Baston were starved of service - characteristically for a Swansea team with just nine goals from 10 Premier League games this season.

It was due for release in Malaysia on Thursday, but Disney said it was being held for a \"review\" of its content. The Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) said on Tuesday it had approved the screening but with \"a minor edit concerning a gay moment in the film\". Homosexual activity is illegal in Muslim majority Malaysia, although the country's tourism minister has said banning the film is \"ridiculous\". A new release date has yet to be announced. The live-action remake was granted a \"P13 parental guidance classification\". \"We have approved the film so there is no more issue. Once a film receives approval, it means it can be screened,\" LPF Chairman Datuk Abdul Hamid said. \"However, the date of screening and where the screening takes place is not under LPF's jurisdiction. We only look at the content and give a decision on whether the movie gets approved or not.\" Local cinema chains have been offering refunds for customers who have purchased tickets in advance. Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon has spoken about the \"exclusively gay moment\" in the film. It involves LeFou - the sidekick of the film's main antagonist Gaston - who tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between lust and admiration, as a side-plot to the main story. The decision to review the Disney classic in Malaysia courted criticism from netizens, many of whom called it \"stupid and laughable\". \"Malaysia bans 'Beauty and the Beast' but is okay with nonsense Malay movies with no moral values, just full of brainless jokes,\" wrote a Twitter user in a tweet which drew more than 4,500 re-tweets.

It also brings the definition of a caravan into line with the rest of the UK. The Private Members Bill was sponsored by UUP MLA, John McAllister. It is the first since 1948 to have gone through all the stages of the Assembly to become law and is likely to take effect from the Autumn. Mr McAllister was congratulated by politicians from other parties including the DUP MLA, Jim Wells, who said he welcomed the legislation. Fabulous \"It will hopefully stop the situation that saw some people signing away their rights to how they insure, sell and maintain their caravans.\" More than 14,000 static holiday caravan owners will also have increased protection including the right to a written contract and to have a greater say in how their caravan site is run. Jack Moore, who lives in a mobile home in Ballyhalbert in County Down, had been campaigning for the change since 2008. \"It's absolutely fabulous it had gone through, it brings us into line with legislation in England and Wales,\" he said. \"We were way behind, the park homes in England have been in use for over 50 years, whereas the park homes here are in their infancy.\" Social Development Minister, Alex Attwood, said: \"For years, some caravan owners have been forced, at the drop of a hat, to accept changes made by site owners. \"Many have faced raised fees, moved caravans and even eviction from sites, without much protection,\" he said. \"This bill will make a real difference to those people, by clearly setting out in law the obligations for site owners and holiday caravan owners.\" \"I'd like to pay tribute to John McCallister, the Bill's sponsor, for his considerable efforts in completing the bill which will make a real difference to the lives of static caravan owners, in both the residential and holiday sectors.\""

During his trial at the Old Bailey, the jury was told he forced a 14-year-old girl to perform a sex act on him after getting her drunk. He had a \"persistent and almost predatory interest\" in girls, the court heard. Det Supt Gary Ridgway from Cambridgeshire Police said the sentence showed \"just how serious this type of offence is\". \"This represents justice for young people who had the courage to stand up in court and relive some very difficult experiences,\" he said. Khubaib was the tenth person to be convicted under Operation Erle, which focussed on allegations of sex abuse by other groups of men and boys against young girls. Four previous cases led to nine male defendants being jailed for 59 offences against 15 girls from Peterborough and elsewhere in the East Midlands. \"We are pleased with this sentence today as it represents justice for the girls and young women who suffered at the hands of this vicious criminal,\" said Wendi Ogle-Welbourn, from Peterborough City Council. She praised the \"bravery\" of the victims who had given evidence during the course of the trial. \"Their courage in reliving some absolutely horrendous experiences at the hands of this criminal has enabled us to get the result we did today and means that other girls and young women are safer in our city,\" she said. Cambridgeshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Sir Graham Bright described Khubaib's actions as \"crime of the worst kind\"."

He added it could threaten Mr Hogg's impartiality in overseeing the police. The commissioner said he would remain impartial and the cost would be repaid in four to five years. Read more on this story as it develops throughout the day on our Local Live pages. The disagreement emerged in an exchange of letters in 2014 seen by the BBC after a freedom of information request to Devon and Cornwall Police. The force confirmed that the chief constable remains concerned about the move, the cost of which has been estimated by the crime commissioner. Mr Hogg currently rents office space at Pynes Hill Business Park in Exeter, which costs about \u00a3100,000 a year. The lease runs out this year, and the commissioner plans to move less than a mile to the Middlemoor complex, where the chief constable and senior officers are based. Almost four years on from their creation, the initial term of office of the first police and crime commissioners is almost complete. In that time, the public, and senior police officers, have become more used to the powerful officials. But, as this row demonstrates, commissioners are no less controversial. And that should make for interesting times as we approach the elections for the new commissioners, in May. A letter seen by the BBC from Mr Sawyer to Mr Hogg in May 2014 said: \"I am not convinced this adds up strategically, operationally or financially. \"I cannot think of a worse time for the OPCC (Office of Police and Crime Commissioner) or the Force to divert time or energy from the job in hand.\" He added: \"I fear the public would see this as not the best use of your time or their money.\" The commissioner replied that the plan was part of a review of the number of buildings Devon and Cornwall Police own or lease, and designed to bring about \"short, medium and long term savings\". Andrew White, chief executive of the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, said in a statement: \"The building doesn't decide if the commissioner is impartial or not. \"I think it will mean an improvement for the public because we'll be spending less money on our estate... so more money will go to policing and that's the most important thing about this change.\" Mr Hogg is expected to decide on whether to go ahead with the move later this year. Mr Sawyer declined to comment."

      "text": "Japan called for an end to the raid, summoning the Algerian ambassador to express concern for the lives of the captives and to plead for up-to-date information. British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was \"disappointed\" not to have been told about the raid in advance. But while many details of how events at the In Amenas plant have unfolded remain unclear, Algeria's decision to deal with the kidnappers forcefully and unilaterally fits with a deeply-entrenched and uncompromising approach to counter-terrorism. \"I'd be surprised if they'd reacted any other way,\" said Jon Marks, an Algeria analyst and head of the Cross-border Information consultancy. \"From the Algerian point of view the attack\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 was an affront to the prestige of the Algerian military which is a very central part of the Algerian value system.\" The military is still seen as the ultimate arbiter of power in Algeria, and has never been placed fully under civilian control. The army, and the governments it supports, derive much of their legitimacy from largely winning the military battle against Islamist insurgents in the 1990s, during a vicious conflict that left as many as 150,000 people dead. Algerian authorities have expressed some bitterness that they were left to fight this conflict on their own, before most of the rest of the world was confronted with the threat from Islamist militancy. But they also take pride in their counter-terrorism experience, their military suppression of armed groups and their publicly-stated reluctance to negotiate or pay ransoms. \"We say that confronted with terrorism, yesterday as today and tomorrow, there will be no negotiation, no blackmail, no let-up in the fight against terrorism,\" said Algerian Communications Minister Mohamed Said Belaid. \"Those who think we will negotiate with terrorists are delusional.\" The conflict in the 1990s was fought in the north of Algeria. Armed groups have only become more active in Algeria's vast southern desert and neighbouring Sahel states in recent years. They have carried out kidnappings, mainly outside Algeria, and have never launched a major attack on the oil and gas industry that has long been the backbone of Algeria's economy. However, both the alleged organiser of Wednesday's attack, Algerian militant Mokhtar Belmokhtar, and the prospect of a drawn-out kidnapping saga, are darkly familiar to the Algerian authorities. \"They know Mokhtar Belmokhtar and his gang very well and they know very well that these are people who are extremely adept at operating in the Sahara regions,\" said Jon Marks, referring to reports that the Algerians intervened when some of the kidnappers and hostages tried to leave the plant. The risk, he said, was that they would take the hostages to a remote part of the desert and then negotiate for ransoms or prisoner exchanges, \"and they used the bluntest of instruments, which was air power, to stop those cars\". \"With the western governments you've got the view which is predominant that they've got a duty of care towards the hostages,\" he added. \"Whereas in the perception of those people running the operation, it was very much, 'you must deal with the terrorists and"

Judge Charles Gratwicke described it as \"a brutal and sick, callous killing\". Jordan Taylor, 22, of Basildon, must serve a minimum of 23 years in jail for murdering Miss Davies just moments after she had ended their relationship. Follow live updates on this story and other Essex news Taylor had denied murder but was found guilty by a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court on Thursday. Sentencing him to life in prison, Judge Gratwicke told Taylor: \"The jury saw through your lies, and saw you for what you are - a devious, jealous and ruthless individual prepared to unleash extreme violence on anyone who crosses your path. \"This was a brutal and sick, callous killing.\" During the eight-day trial the court heard Taylor and Miss Davies had been together since December 2014. He had moved into the flat which came with her job as a groom at the sanctuary. Miss Davies had told friends she planned to end the relationship on the evening of 3 July last year - the night she was murdered. The kitchen knife Taylor turned on Miss Davies had been used with such force it was bent to a 45-degree angle. The court heard Taylor claimed he stabbed her twice in self-defence after she attacked him. Things went \"foggy\" after that, he said. He said he could not remember most of the attack and denied murdering Miss Davies. However, the Crown Prosecution Service described it as a \"vicious and sustained attack\" carried out by Taylor while he was in a \"jealous rage\" after Miss Davies ended the relationship. Prosecutors said the attack on Miss Davies began in the flat in Pitsea Hall Lane, then continued outside as she fled in her pyjamas. Taylor had denied initially making \"disfiguring\" cuts to Miss Davies' face and left breast as \"punishment\" for trying to end the relationship, before eventually going on to kill her. CCTV footage showed Taylor attempting to hoist Miss Davies' near-lifeless body over a hedge out of view. He was found by police crouching in bushes near her body. Miss Davies died later that night in Basildon Hospital. Taylor was charged with her murder. The jury heard Taylor, a martial arts enthusiast, had tried to control a number of aspects of Miss Davies' life. Her mother Dyanne Lambert told the court he would not allow her daughter to wear short-sleeved or low-cut tops and the couple would often argue. \"She became very quiet and didn't want to talk about what was going on,\" she said. Speaking after Taylor was sentenced, Mrs Lambert said: \"Obviously nothing will bring our Laura back but we are glad that he will be off the streets for a very long time. \"Twenty-three years is long, but it will not bring our baby back.\" Miss Davies' father, John Davies, said: \"We've lost Laura forever and it's very hard to deal with. \"We thank the justice system for all their work and for the sentence,"

His comments followed an article in the Washington Post which said that Mr Obama learned last August of President Vladimir Putin's \"direct involvement\". The alleged meddling is the subject of high-level investigations in the US. President Putin has repeatedly denied any Russian interference into the presidential election. The Washington Post article says Mr Obama was told early last August by sources deep within the Russian government that Mr Putin was directly involved in a cyber campaign to disrupt the election, injure Hillary Clinton and aid a Trump victory. The Post said Mr Obama secretly debated dozens of options to punish Russia but in the end settled on what it called symbolic measures - the expulsion of 35 diplomats and closure of two Russian compounds. They came in late December, well after the election. The Post reported that Mr Obama was concerned he might himself be seen as trying to manipulate the election. The paper quoted a former administration official as saying: \"From national security people there was a sense of immediate introspection, of, 'Wow, did we mishandle this'.\" Measures Mr Obama had considered but which were not put into action included planting cyber weapons in the Russian infrastructure and releasing information personally damaging to Mr Putin. Imagine, for a moment, that you're Barack Obama in August 2016. You've just been informed by the CIA that Vladimir Putin has ordered a wide-ranging effort to disrupt the US presidential election. What do you do? Mr Obama responded in typical fashion - cautiously. He alerted state officials, warned Russia and attempted (unsuccessfully) to fashion a bipartisan response with Republicans in Congress. Now the second-guessing has begun. Some Democrats are saying the Obama team should have gone public with such a startling discovery before election day. The president feared such a move would prompt the Republican nominee to accuse him of meddling and undermine faith in the electoral process. He believed Mrs Clinton was going to win anyway, so it was best not to rock the boat. Mr Trump himself is now questioning why Mr Obama didn't do more - a curious position given that he recently described the Russia hacking story as a Democratic \"hoax\". These latest revelations add yet another wrinkle to a 2016 campaign that will be hashed and rehashed for the foreseeable future. The most pressing question now, however, is not what Mr Obama did. It's what the US government does next. Mr Trump tweeted on Friday: \"The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?\" He followed that up with two more tweets on Saturday, the second saying: \"Obama Administration official said they \"choked\" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?\" He repeats the argument in an interview with Fox News, which will air on Sunday. \"If he had the information, why didn't he do something about it? He should have done"

The overwhelming majority of climbers only tackle the highest mountain in the world with the help of at least one guide and a well-equipped support team at base camp. \"I have no idea of the outcome regarding my Everest no-permit climb,\" Mr Davy posted on Facebook on Tuesday Mr Gyawali said that the climber made his way back to Kathmandu using the same route from the base camp that Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay followed in 1953 when they became the first people to climb the mountain. The route goes through the small mid-hill town of Jiri. Nepal relies heavily on income generated from Everest expeditions and some believe the authorities will want to make an example out of Mr Davy to deter other climbers from dodging the permit fee. Mr Davy said on Facebook: \"Expedition companies have no time for wannabe Everesters with no money so someone turned me in.\" The climber said he could expect to spend time in jail in addition to a fine of $22,000."

It is the first time a 7 Tesla MRI scanner will be used in the UK in a clinical setting. It will be used to improve treatment for conditions such as stroke, vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The facility was built in collaboration with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHS GGC), with \u00a316m of funding from the Medical Research Council and Glasgow City Region City Deal. The project is expected to bring 396 new jobs to the city over a seven year period, contributing about \u00a388m to the local economy. The 7 Tesla MRI scanner was delivered to the site last November. A giant crane eased the 18-tonne device down an alleyway with inches to spare on each side, then through a hole in the wall of the new building. The building will also house the Clinical Innovation Zone to help biomedical companies improve healthcare technology through collaborative work. There willl be a further floor of neuro-operating theatres, which will be funded by the NHS GGC. Prof Dame Anna Dominiczak, of the College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, said it would be a \"world-leading\" example of a precision medicine centre. \"The ICE isn't about ivory tower research,\" she said. \"It is about bringing world-leading clinical academics together with industry to collaborate and to create something that not only positively benefits patients but also brings a meaningful economic benefit as well.\" Glasgow City Council leader Frank McAveety said the facility was a great example of how the Glasgow City Region City Deal was helping to reinforce Glasgow's global reputation, while also delivering economic and social benefits. Principal of the university, Prof Anton Muscatelli, said: \"ICE exemplifies the university's goal to create visionary buildings that promote interaction with industry and other key stakeholders, bringing inspiring people together in a world-class environment to share knowledge that can ultimately change the world.\""

They were among eight athletes sanctioned for doping - the latest to be caught under a retesting programme. The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) last year ruled any nations with three or more positive tests would be banned for a year. The IOC is retesting hundreds of samples from the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games, using new techniques to uncover cheating that went undetected at the time. Cao Lei, 33, took gold in the women's 75kg weightlifting event at Beijing, Chen Xiexia, 34, won the women's 48kg and Liu Chunhong, 31, was successful in the women's 69kg. All will now have to return their medals. The failed retests were uncovered last year but the sanctions - announced by the IOC on Thursday - will clear the way for the IWF to act. The IWF issued new measures before last year's Rio Olympics to crack down on doping in the sport. Its executive board decided \"national federations confirmed to have produced three or more anti-doping rule violations in the combined re-analysis process of the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games shall be suspended for one year\". Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Russia and Belarus have already been banned by the IWF.

Researchers analysed data from patients who were taking bisphosphonates, which are used to prevent the loss of bone material. However, scientists say further studies are still needed. When joints become damaged or worn out, commonly due to osteoarthritis, it can be painful and limits movement. An implant can dramatically improve a patient's mobility. More than 50,000 hip and 70,000 knee, replacements take place in the UK each year. While they can last for decades, some fail within years. This can happen when the bone around the implant is dissolved by the body meaning the replacement joint becomes loose. The theory was that bisphosphonates, which are used by patients with osteoporosis to prevent bone being broken down, would prevent the loosening. The researchers looked at data from General Practice Research Database for joint replacements and compared what happened to 1,912 patients taking bisphosphonates with 41,995 patients who did not. After five years, 1.96% of implants failed without the drug, compared with 0.93% in those taking medication. Prof Nigel Arden, a specialist in rheumatic diseases at the Universities of Oxford and Southampton, said the first implant would cost the NHS about \u00c2\u00a37,000, but replacements would cost \u00c2\u00a334,000. He told the BBC: \"It has the potential to have a huge impact.\" He said two of the risk factors, age and obesity, meant the number of cases was \"increasing dramatically\". Prof Arden is not arguing that people should be given the drug yet. He has applied for funding for a further trial to test the effectiveness of bisphosphonates and which patients would benefit most. The chief medical officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies welcomed the findings. \"With such a high incidence of knee and hip replacement surgery, the possibility that the life of joint implants could be lengthened and reduce the number of complex revision surgeries means that these results have the potential to make significant improvements to the lives of many NHS patients,\" she said."

Taking the pills while pregnant without medical approval is illegal in the UK. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said as awareness of the online pills increased, more women were using them. The figures, from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - which regulates medicines in the UK - show there were 375 pills seized last year, up from 270 in 2015 and 180 in 2014. The seizures were made during the MHRA's annual week-long raids, known as Operation Pangea, at places like postal hubs where foreign post is kept before being distributed to local post offices. NHS abortion treatment is free and widely available in Britain, but remains mostly illegal in Northern Ireland. However, the UK currently has the harshest punishment for self-induced abortion of any country in Europe, bar the Republic of Ireland. Under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, anyone taking the pills could, in theory, be punished with a life sentence - no matter what the gestational period. Two women have been jailed for using the abortion pill bought online in the UK. In 2012, 40-year-old Sarah Catt was jailed for eight years for terminating her pregnancy with pills she had bought online when she was 39 weeks pregnant. Natalie Towers, 26, was sentenced to two-and-a half-years in 2015 after using the pill to terminate her pregnancy while she was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant. Bpas and other women's groups are supporting a bill, proposed by Labour MP Diana Johnson, to be debated in the House of Commons next month, which seeks to decriminalise abortion. Some women have revealed why they were driven to using abortion pills purchased online. \"I was hoping to have a termination in the comfort of my own home without judgmental eyes and without worrying about my husband knowing. I fear what would happen if he did,\" one woman said. \"I have three children and my third is 11 months old. I considered an abortion when he was conceived and had a terrible pregnancy and [I am] still suffering from post natal depression.\" Another, a foreign student living in the UK, said she felt \"desperate\". \"I cannot afford this country's prices of procedure, and the place in line for supported abortions is just too long and not guaranteed. \"I feel absolutely horrible and desperate.\" Clara Watson, education officer for the charity Life, said the promotion of buying abortion pills online was dangerous. \"Some women aren't suitable for the abortion pill and may suffer from blood clots, there may be other underlying health issues, they may not know how far along they are. It's too risky,\" she said. Ann Furedi, Bpas chief executive, said women who bought the pills were often \"desperate\" and in \"difficult circumstances\". \"At Bpas, we do all that we can to make abortion services as accessible as possible. However, it is clear that for some women the barriers to clinic-based treatment feel insurmountable,\" she said."

An Information Commissioner has said LLDC, which denied the claims, must now comply with the FOI request. LLDC had refused to reveal its rent on grounds of commercial sensitivity. The decision comes ahead of West Ham moving into the stadium for the start of the 2016-2017 football season. In reaching a decision dated 3 September, the commissioner said neither West Ham nor LLDC had been able to show how revealing the details of the tenancy agreement would place them at a commercial disadvantage or how this information could be exploited by a competitor. The stadium was built using tax payers' money and is currently in public ownership. LLDC manages the stadium and is believed to be considering whether to appeal against the independent commissioner's decision. A coalition of 14 supporters' trusts from around the country called on LLDC head, London Mayor Boris Johnson, to waive its right to appeal. They said an appeal would further delay the publication of the tenancy agreement, which they argue is in the public interest. In a statement, the trusts said the deal raised issues over the apparent use of public money to \"subsidise a commercial football business\". \"It seems the taxpayer will be paying the cost of a series of overheads which every other club, rightly, has to pay for themselves,\" they said. \"It is important that the taxpayer is allowed to know exactly what has gone on here, and to judge whether it is a responsible and fair use of public money.\" The supporters' trusts had argued the Olympic Stadium deal could give the Hammers a competitive advantage and asked the government to investigate in August, but the government said the deal had been \"scrutinised\" and rejected their request. Previously a spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: \"West Ham United has a concession at the stadium and their contributions reflect that status. \"The contract, awarded after an open public competition, has been widely scrutinised and tested in court. The stadium remains in public ownership and the profits from its multiple uses will flow to the taxpayer.\" The Olympic Stadium deal allows West Ham to host all of their home matches at the stadium. British Athletics will take control of the arena for one month every summer. LLDC has until 8 October to reveal the commercial details of the Olympic Stadium tenancy agreement."

The BPA said it could not comment further as they were \"still in the process of our investigation\". UKPC has also been reported to Action Fraud and the complaint is currently being assessed by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau. Alex Shipp, who campaigns as the Parking Prankster, said: \"I think this merits a full investigation, rather than just acknowledging the few cases we know about so far.\" The issue came to light in Lincoln when Simone Riley-Young was issued with a parking charge notice while parked at Tritton Retail Park on 18 July. Drivers can park there free of charge for up to two hours. The timestamps on the photos said 07:15 and 09:27, but Ms Riley-Young said the earlier time was impossible as she was still in bed. Another driver, Matthew Treacy, had the same problem at the car park on 23 August. The timestamps on the photos of his car said 14:06 and 16:21, but Mr Treacy said he had four independent sources to prove his car could not have been in the car park at 14:06. UKPC operates more than 1,400 sites nationwide and similar problems have been reported outside Lincoln, including in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. Talking about the Lincoln incidents, UKPC said there had been a full investigation. \"This behaviour is completely contrary to UKPC's operating procedures and employees who do not adhere to our high professional standards or codes of conduct are subject to disciplinary proceedings up to and including dismissal,\" a spokesman said. \"We have put steps in place to mitigate the risk of this reoccurring.\" The BBC contacted UKPC again about incidents elsewhere in the country, but the company has not responded."

Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were \"misguided\". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than \u00c2\u00a311,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to \"incentivise best quality practice\" and \"drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care\". \"Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,\" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the \"full impact\" of the incentive scheme and was \"confident that there is no conflict of interest\". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a \"financial contaminant\" to patient-doctor trust. He said: \"It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. \"We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms.\" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than \u00c2\u00a36,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. \"It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,\" he explained. \"The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service.\" Analysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs The NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out \u00c2\u00a322bn of efficiency savings by 2020.

Special Report: The Technology of Business Make-It-Yourself: The rise of the micro-manufacturers Could high-end camping gear save lives around the world? Could renting Fido make you rich? The maps transforming how we interact with the world Is 'mind control' now a reality? But what if a new kind of power station could create electricity without belching harmful gases into the air? Despite the development of renewable technologies, fossil fuels are still used to generate the overwhelming majority of the world's power, and it is likely they will continue to do so for many years. In the US, about 70% of the country's electricity comes from burning fossil fuels. Other major economies, such as China, are even more dependent. But now Net Power, based in the US state of North Carolina, believes it can redesign the power plant so it can still run on coal or natural gas, but without releasing harmful fumes. Rodney Allam, chief technologist at 8 Rivers Capital, which owns Net Power, says: \"The perception has been that to avoid emissions of [carbon dioxide] CO2, we have to get rid of fossil fuels. \"But unfortunately, fossil fuels represent over 70% of the fuel that's consumed in the world and the idea that you can get rid of that in any meaningful sense is a pipe dream.\" The Net Power system is different from currently operating power plants because carbon dioxide, normally produced as waste when making electricity, would become a key ingredient when burning the fuel. A brief history of climate change Carbon dioxide would be put into the Net Power combustor at a very high temperature and pressure along with the fuel, such as natural gas or coal, and oxygen. Using the carbon dioxide as a so-called working fluid - used to make the turbine function - it would pass through the system in a loop, to be recycled and used again. Mr Allam says: \"I've developed a system where we can actually make use of the impurity itself to try and assist the removal of that impurity from the power system.\" In addition, Net Power believes its technology would be cheaper to operate than current power stations. Mr Allam says: \"It was my ambition to create a cycle which would be cheaper - or at least as cheap - as existing technology without CO2 capture, and yet go for 100% CO2 capture.\" The system is geared to enable a process called carbon capture and storage (CCS), which would see the excess carbon dioxide from the fuel combustion funnelled into a pipeline or a tanker instead of being released into the air. Mr Allam says that because the whole cycle happens at a high pressure of about 320 atmospheres, the gas emerges with a pressure and level of purity that is \"capture ready\" - or ideal for storage. This is different from the carbon dioxide produced by other kinds of power plants, which is mixed with gases such"

The university is withdrawing \u00c2\u00a318m of investments over the next decade. It comes after students had mounted a campaign calling for the change. More than 1,300 were involved in the campaign, which included rallies and fake oil spills. David Newall, secretary of the university's governing body, said: \"The university recognises the devastating impact that climate change may have on our planet, and the need for the world to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. \"Over the coming years we will steadily reduce our investment in the fossil fuel extraction industry, while also taking steps to reduce our carbon consumption.\" The university will freeze new investments in fossil fuels and, over 10 years, divest its hydrocarbon investment which is around 4% of its total endowment. Glasgow joins 13 American universities and many other institutions who together have pledged to withdraw more than $50bn in assets from the fossil fuel industry. Just before the recent New York climate summit, the heirs to the Rockefeller fortune announced they planned to pull their funds from fossil fuels. Campaigners say that, so far, 181 institutions and 656 individuals have agreed to withdraw their money from fossil fuels. Students in many universities are lobbying for governors to divest but are often meeting strong resistance from governing bodies charged with prudent investment of university funds. Glasgow has confirmed that its commitment is subject to reassurance that the financial impact for the university is acceptable. Its effects will be monitored by the governing body. Campaigner Callum Shaw, said: \"Among students the argument about whether climate change exists is not really happening - people have read the academic papers and are not in any doubt. We started out as a small group, but the campaign quickly gained traction.\" Other British universities are also set to consider the issue. The School of Oriental and African Studies is expected to make a divestment decision in the next month. Decisions are also imminent from a handful of other institutions including the University of Edinburgh. Oxford University and its colleges are consulting on divestment from $3.8bn worth of investment. More than 1,000 Oxford students and academics have joined the campaign. Scientific reports have suggested it will only be possible to burn about a third of the fossil fuels already discovered and keep a stable climate. Mary Church from Friends of the Earth Scotland said: \"Well done Glasgow for becoming the first university in the UK to take this hugely important step. Not only is this great news for the planet, but it also makes good financial sense [because] at some point this carbon bubble is going to have to burst.\" So far the divestments worldwide have not dented investments in the fossil fuel industry. Oil, gas and coal companies form one of the world's largest asset classes, worth nearly $5 trillion at current stock market values.

The Dreamliner had originally been scheduled for delivery in 2008, but Boeing has suffered a string of setbacks. Boeing plans to make 10 of the planes a month from 2013. Wednesday's flight is a special charter, with normal services due to start in November. Because of the materials used in construction, Boeing says the Dreamliner is about 20% more fuel efficient than similarly sized models flying today. That would be a big help for airlines coping with the high cost of jet fuel, which is usually their biggest single cost. Japan, a country in which Boeing dominates rival Airbus, is a major market for the Dreamliner. ANA will take delivery of dozens more of the aircraft in the coming years. But Boeing's delays have hurt its business. Last week, China Eastern Airlines cancelled orders for 24 Dreamliners, rather than wait for production to pick up."

Rory McKenzie's cross deflected off Brian Easton and deceived Alan Mannus to put Killie ahead and they held on for a maiden home win of the season. The Rugby Park side draw level on points with seventh-place Saints, who must pick themselves up for a Scottish League Cup tie at Rangers on Tuesday. Killie and Saints were chasing their first home and away wins of the campaign, respectively. And after last week's morale-boosting Tannadice triumph over Dundee United, Gary Locke sent the same team out again, resisting the temptation to throw in new signing Conrad Balatoni. Last week's hat-trick hero Steven MacLean was forced to sit out the match on the artificial surface with John Sutton plugging the gap up front for St Johnstone. Kilmarnock have toiled at times on their own patch and have twice been bludgeoned at home this season. Dundee and Ross County both left Killie licking their wounds with 4-0 butcherings. The match opened in quiet and even fashion with Saints striker Cummins claiming he had been hauled down just inside the box but referee Willie Collum was not interested. The visitors did not have to wait long to get in front, however. After excellent play by Liam Craig, Easton crossed for Cummins, whose header beat Jamie MacDonald and rebounded off the post allowing the on-hand Wotherspoon to slot home. It was just Wotherspoon's second goal in more than two years. Saints had been the better team and looked the more dangerous; despite Killie seeing more of the ball they struggled to break down their visitors' defence. As the match drew closer to the interval, the hosts began to grab the game by the scruff of the neck. Killie's best bet appeared to be in the wide areas and it was from there they would level proceedings. Greg Kiltie exhibited what he can do with a superb cross for Magennis, who stretched his neck to loop a header past Mannus and equalise. Killie had won just one of the previous 15 meetings with Saints and it was Magennis who scored both that day. While Killie lost Daryl Westlake to injury in the first half, Darnell Fisher was withdrawn at the interval for Saints with Mark O'Hara and Steven Anderson the respective replacements. MacDonald has been inspirational for Kilmarnock this season and one of Locke's worst nightmares became reality when an early second-half collision saw him succumb to the injury. Ulsterman Conor Brennan replaced him at the end of a week that saw him recalled from a loan at Stranraer after fellow keeper Devlin McKay left for Derby County. However, it was his opposite number Mannus who was left watching in horror as Killie turned the game on its head. McKenzie's cross from the touchline nicked off Easton and looped over the Northern Irishman. The St Johnstone supporters would look on aghast again moments later when Michael O'Halloran was denied by"

New standards were introduced by the Welsh government over a year ago aimed at ensuring equal access to healthcare. But the report says little progress has been made. Richard Williams, director of Action on Hearing Loss Cymru said the charities that authored the report are \"really concerned\" that people are leaving surgeries and hospitals unclear about what doctors have told them, what medication they need or whether operations have been successful. New standards were brought in after a BBC Wales investigation in 2013 found health boards were breaching equality laws by not providing accessible services for the deaf and hard of hearing. But 91 per cent of people surveyed for the report said they were not aware of improvements in the way healthcare providers communicate and share information with them. Kay Coleman from Swansea began losing her hearing 15 years ago and said she finds it \"incredibly difficult\" to book a doctor's appointment. An estimated 500,000 people are affected by hearing loss and 100,000 are living with sight loss in Wales. In a statement the Welsh government said it is \"committed to ensuring the standards are fully implemented\" and it is working with relevant bodies \"to establish how best to capture and record communication preferences for those with sensory loss to ensure their needs are fully met in every healthcare setting\"."

He took deposits before repeatedly cancelling move-in dates claiming his son was battling cancer and had died. Jackson previously admitted fraud at Cardiff Crown Court. Andrew Kendall, prosecuting, said Jackson told his victims he needed \u00a31,400 to secure the property and arrange a move-in date only to later claim he could not drop off the keys to Cardiff because his son was ill in Plymouth. \"He'd say things like he blamed nurses for not stitching his son back properly and even told one victim his son had died,\" he said. Mr Kendall said the lies had a \"great impact\" on some victims, with one couple left homeless and another left living in a caravan. He also pressured one woman into borrowing money from friends and selling possessions so he could \"reserve\" the home for her. Mr Kendall said Jackson was eventually found out when some victims found news reports on him being jailed in 2012 for again using his two-year-old son to defraud \u00a360,000. The former Tesco store manager tricked his workmates for three years, claiming he had cancer and his son had cerebral palsy. Staff donated money to pay for private treatment but he used it to fund holidays to Las Vegas and Hawaii. David Pinnell, defending, said Jackson was \"genuinely remorseful\" and had used the money to pay off debts to people who protected him in prison. Jailing him for two years, Recorder of Cardiff Eleri Rees, told him: \"You have to understand given your track record for elaborate lies the court finds it hard to take what you're saying at face value. \"Some of the victims were in precarious financial situations so the impact on them has been very serious.

Beyond the blood-soaked steps, the floor is strewn with debris: scattered prayer mats, beads, smashed spectacles and pages from the Koran. There are bullet marks on the pillars and the suicide bombers' blood can be seen splattered across the walls and right up inside the dome. \"We heard a loud sound outside, but people said let's continue praying,\" said Adamu Magashi, who was inside facing the imam who had just finished his sermon at the time of the attack. \"Then a bomb went off right inside the mosque and somebody started shooting. We tried to move towards the imam and there was another blast - we couldn't even see each other as we tried to escape,\" he told me after returning to the scene. Outside, a large crowd stands over the twisted remains of the motorbikes and bicycles that were engulfed in the flames when the first bomber struck, driving a car into the assembled worshippers. Policemen occasionally disperse the agitated throng. Another crowd stares at a collection of blackened shoes that has been gathered up in the large open sandy area in front of the green domed mosque. \"This was the first time ever the five daily prayers were not observed in this mosque,\" one shocked man, who has often prayed here, told me, describing the attack as unimaginable. On Friday, the terror swiftly turned to fury when three of the gunmen were overpowered right outside the mosque. They were beaten and burnt to death. Had their lives been spared, they could have provided useful intelligence on the group behind the violence - not that the police have a good record of investigating and prosecuting. Boko Haram's former leader Mohammed Yusuf was killed when in police custody in 2009. At one of the hospitals, where the hundreds of injured are being treated, the police had to intervene to stop a mob lynching a man who had somehow caused fury by taking a photograph. By targeting such a prominent place of worship, the jihadists have sent shockwaves right across Nigeria. This was not just another attack - Boko Haram seemed to be stating it had no respect for the way Islam is practised here. The people of Kano have been shocked and traumatised before by bombers and gunmen working in tandem. This was by no means the first Boko Haram attack on a mosque. But it was possibly the most devastating. And whilst some have portrayed the Boko Haram insurgency as a war on Christianity, this attack is yet another stark reminder that the vast majority of victims in the conflict have been Muslims. Back in April 2007, a high-profile Muslim cleric was killed in Kano. Sheikh Ja'afar Mahmoud Adam, was gunned down as he prayed at a mosque here after criticising the group's hardline ideology. Seven years on and the list of targets has grown"

They were intelligence officers operating here and using these compounds, one in New York, one in Maryland, for intelligence collection purposes.

It has even been painted in the same battleship grey and is manned and operated by US Navy personnel who will rotate on six-month tours as if they were at sea. They might as well be, because there are few signs of human life nearby. Devesulu is the first land-based ballistic interceptor system to be set up in Europe. At a ceremony attended by Romanian, US and Nato leaders on Thursday it was declared \"operational\". It is now able to fire \"a bullet at a bullet\": the interceptor missile tries to hit a ballistic missile on re-entry into the earth's atmosphere. Work is now starting on building a second base in northern Poland. Together with four US Aegis warships, these Aegis Ashore sites will provide a network that can identify, track and shoot down ballistic missiles fired towards Europe. Turkey already has an early warning radar that activates the Aegis system and will eventually be joined by one in the UK. Dutch and Danish warships are also being fitted with sensors that will plug into the system. It will all be controlled from the US base in Ramstein, Germany. Ostensibly under Nato control, in reality it is the US that is largely driving and funding this programme. So where does the threat come from? Nato's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, says \"many countries are seeking to develop or acquire their own ballistic missiles\". The Middle East region is often mentioned but US officials have been more specific in naming Iran as a potential aggressor. Despite the recent agreement on Tehran's nuclear programme, it is pressing ahead with its own ballistic missile programme. Still, it seems odd to ramp up the pressure on Iran so soon after it's made concessions to the West. As for other \"threats from the Middle East\" it is all rather vague. Strangely, the clearest language from both Nato and US officials is about what the system is not. \"It's not about Russia\" is the prefix to any description of the system. At the Deveselu ceremony the US Deputy Defence Secretary, Robert Work, said: \"I want to make clear - neither this site, nor the site going into Poland - will have the capacity to undermine Russia's strategic (nuclear) deterrent.\" Mr Stoltenberg insisted: \"The interceptors are too few and located too far south to intercept Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles.\" The language, though, appears to be deliberately precise. There is no mention of Russian short and medium range ballistic missiles. Nor is there any denial that the sensors will be able to look into Russian territory. Few would argue the two nations housing the land-based interceptors, Romania and Poland, are more worried about say Iran or North Korea's actions than their biggest and nearest neighbour. There are, of course, plenty of good reasons to play down any potential impact on Russia as tensions are already high. Russia has been flexing its military"

In June, troops loyal to South Sudan President Salva Kiir clashed with those of his deputy, Riek Machar. The two had fought a civil war which killed tens of thousands until Mr Machar returned to the capital, Juba, in April under a peace deal. The latest violence began when five Kiir loyalists were killed at a checkpoint, before escalating into confrontations that left hundreds dead. Listen to Dafa Dafa The wounds of war in South Sudan Africa Live: More on this and other news stories \"I'm calling upon all of us to leave revenge behind, and forgive each other,\" MC Lumoex said. \"Forgiveness is what we need for this nation to go forward.\" Another artist, Linus the Genius, backed his call: \"The only way we can send our message to people is through music. \"We can't hold a gun and fight - but this is how we can bring peace in South Sudan - through music.\" The song combines a myriad of styles, and a mix of local languages: Juba Arabic, Bari and Zande are represented, as well as Dinka and Nuer, the languages of Mr Kiir and Mr Machar, respectively. The musicians come from different bands based in Juba. \"I wish my talent could be a weapon,\" goes one of the lines sung by Mandari, from the Hardlife Avenue Stars. \"I would use it to protect my people.\" One of the most haunting lyrics is sung by Nicky Prince, who worries about the future of the country. \"We don't know how our country's going to develop because the people who are meant to develop it are just dying,\" it goes. Dafa Dafa is already getting radio airplay in Juba. The band says it will not make money from the song, but hopes to reach the ears of the men in charge. \"We don't even know why they're fighting\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We just wish that they listen to our song and hear the message,\" says Mandari."

A large number of paramilitary troops and police have been deployed to maintain peace in the hill region. Tourism and tea production will be worst hit by the strike, locals say. The strike began at 06:00 India time (00:30GMT) on Monday and reports say there is little traffic on the highway that connects Darjeeling with the town of Siliguri in the plains of north Bengal. About a dozen supporters of the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) were held after they set a motorcycle and a car on fire in the Rambi area, the Press Trust of India news agency said. Supporters also blocked roads in the region. Darjeeling town was largely deserted with tourists staying away from the hills. Reports said 1,000 GJM supporters were protesting at Chowkbazar with party flags, while large gatherings were also reported from Jorbungalow, Mirik and Sukhiapokhri. Roads were also barricaded by the GJM in Kalimpong and Kurseong towns. The GJM has written to PM Manmohan Singh urging him to accept their demand for a separate state they want named Gorkhaland. \"Our demand for Gorkhaland is an old one and generations of our people have fought for it. Now we want it because we see no future for us in West Bengal,\" said GJM general secretary Roshan Giri. Mr Giri said as the Congress-led government in Delhi was \"considering\" creating a new state of Telangana to be carved out of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, \"it was about time they concede Gorkhaland\". \"Our demand for a separate state is as old, as justified and meaningful as that of a separate Telangana,\" he added. In June 2011, the GJM signed a deal with the Indian government and the government of West Bengal state for greater autonomy. The deal paved the way for the setting up of a Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), an elected body for the Darjeeling hills. It is not clear whether the GJM will now relinquish its responsibility of running the GTA. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerji has said she is upset with the revived agitation and warned that it will be \"tackled in a tough way if it turned violent\". The Gorkha campaign for a separate state started in the early 1980s. But a settlement that gave them considerable autonomy brought the movement to an end in 1988. However, five years ago, the movement was resumed by Gorkha hardliners who say the autonomy arrangement has not worked."

      "text": "The Washington Post demanded impeachment, followed by a Senate trial. Time magazine, deeming it necessary to publish its first-ever editorial, thundered: \"The president should resign.\" Outside the White House, protesters waved placards at passing motorists: \"Honk for Impeachment.\" Even Washington's most influential columnist, Stewart Alsop, who was normally supportive of the president, called him an \"ass.\" The president had lost his moral authority, argued his critics, and with it, his ability to govern. The country faced a constitutional crisis. The republic was imperilled. Such was the feverish reaction to the events of 20 October, 1973, a date remembered in the national memory as the \"Saturday Night Massacre\" - a pivotal moment in the unfolding Watergate controversy. With scandal engulfing the White House, Richard Nixon decided to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor appointed to investigate \"all offenses arising out of the 1972 election \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 involving the president, the White House staff or presidential appointments\". Nixon's Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, and his Deputy Attorney General, William Ruckelshaus, resigned rather than carry out the president's order. Eventually, the Solicitor General Robert Bork, who was third in command at the justice department, was prepared to fire Cox. The White House announced the news at 8:22pm that Saturday evening. Yesterday, almost as quickly as the news that he had been sacked as head of the FBI reached James Comey in Los Angeles, these two dramatic episodes were being described as historically analogous. The president had fired the lead figure in an investigation into alleged wrongdoing by members of his own team. The Nixonian parallels were obvious. Roger Stone, a Trump associate who also worked in 1972 for the notorious Committee to Re-elect the President, told the New York Times: \"Somewhere Dick Nixon is smiling.\" The Nixon presidential library even trolled the White House on Twitter: \"FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian.\" Democrats insinuated that Comey was fired for similar reasons to Cox, because he was closing in on the truth. There were other resemblances, too. In the lead-up to the Saturday Night Massacre, the Nixon White House was still reeling from the resignation of the president's chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, a central figure in the Watergate scandal, just as the Trump administration continues to be buffeted by the swirl of controversy surrounding the forced departure of General Michael Flynn, his former National Security Advisor. There's the suspicion now, as there was four decades ago, that an embattled White House has something to hide. So is this truly a re-run of the events of 1973? Is the past repeating itself? Even by the standards of the Nixon presidency, the autumn of 1973 was unusually chaotic. It saw the resignation of Vice-President Spiro Agnew because of fraud, tax evasion, bribery and extortion allegations. The Middle East was in the grip of the Yom Kippur war, a conflict between US-backed Israel and Arab forces armed by the Soviets that threatened to blow-up into a broader conflagration between Washington and Moscow. In Washington, Nixon was fighting a pitched battle with Archibald Cox"

One security expert said the breach may have been a product of complacency. Ministers insist the police did their job and Parliament can't be sealed off - and a security review is under way. A Parliamentary spokesman said security was always under \"constant review\" but the building had to remain \"open and accessible\" for it to function. The review follows the fatal stabbing of PC Keith Palmer in the grounds of the Palace of Westminster. Ministers have declined to comment on unconfirmed reports that his alleged assailant was shot dead by a member of Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon's close protection team, who happened to be at the scene, rather than a uniformed officer stationed at the gate. Some MPs regard the carriage gates entrance, which is used by government cars to drop off and pick up ministers, as a weak point in the security perimeter. It is manned by two police officers but they are not always armed and the gate is often open, unlike other entrances to the Palace of Westminster. The Times reported that a 2005 review had found the entrance to be a weak point, primarily due to the number of delivery vans using it. The paper quoted parliamentary sources as saying any changes at the time had been regarded as \"too cumbersome\". The Met Police said the current security arrangements had been in place for many years and were \"designed to provide access to the seat of our government balanced carefully with security that is proportionate but not overly intrusive\". \"Of course, after an incident like this, as would be expected, my team will work with parliamentary authorities to assess whether a different tone or a different balance is necessary,\" Assistant Deputy Commissioner Mark Rowley said on Friday. Parliament, which oversees its own security, said the arrangements should reflect the level of risk it faced. \"As is good practice following any significant incident, the Houses in conjunction with the police and other bodies will also be carrying out a review of security around this specific incident,\" a spokesman said. Former Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers has said there is now a case for all police officers guarding Parliament and other \"sensitive sites\" to be routinely armed. There are two Metropolitan Police officers manning Carriage Gates at all times. Behind the gates there is a hut staffed by a third officer, whose job is to monitor pedestrians exiting the estate. All three officers are issued with stab vests. They check to ensure the driver of a vehicle or bicycle has the correct parliamentary pass. Cars are security vetted beyond the gates. They all have two way radios so can call for help in emergencies. Armed police are on patrol throughout the Parliamentary estate at all times but they are more visible at times of heightened security. Security expert Professor Anthony Glees said the attack had demonstrated a \"lack of protection\" within Parliament. \"I am"

Mesh or tape implants are used to treat organ prolapse or urinary incontinence. These conditions can be common after childbirth. The board's letter, leaked to the BBC, advised GPs to refer the women back to the health trust that performed the surgery with a letter stating that the referral is \"because of problems associated with mesh surgery\". The letter goes on to state that each trust should have arrangements in place for these women to be seen by a consultant. A spokesperson for the local action group, which now has over 250 members, welcomed the move but told the BBC that it was sad that some women had to go public with their personal stories in order for some health professionals to take them seriously. In July, a group of women from across the UK affected by vaginal mesh implants, including many from Northern Ireland, met with MPs at Westminster as part of a campaign to ban the procedure."

At least 87 people have been taken to hospital in the Napa area, a renowned wine-producing region and tourist area. California Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in order to deal with the effects of the quake. Officials in Napa said in a statement that the quake - believed to be the biggest in the region in 25 years - had destroyed four mobile homes and made 16 buildings \"uninhabitable\", as well as causing \"approximately 50\" gas main breaks and around 30 leaks from water mains. The clear-up operation will begin in earnest on Monday. At least three of those injured in Napa are in a serious condition. Three historic buildings in the town had been hit and two commercial buildings \"severely damaged\", the statement went on. By Sunday evening, between 11,000 and 15,000 people were still reported without power, down from 70,000 people in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. At least 33 buildings in the city of 77,000 have been \"red-tagged\", which means that they have been designated as unsafe to enter, Community Development Director Rick Tooker was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. A Red Cross evacuation centre has been set up in a church in the city. The California Highway Patrol in the San Francisco Bay area tweeted that it was \"checking over crossings and bridges for obvious signs of structural integrity\", and asked residents to report any signs of problems. \"They say [the quake] went for 50 seconds. It felt like 50 minutes. I was just too terrified to even scream,\" antique shop owner Patricia Trimble told Reuters. The front window of her shop was destroyed, with cabinets on their sides and merchandise strewn across the floor. The site of the earthquake was 51 miles from Sacramento and about 30 miles north-east of San Francisco. Numerous small aftershocks were also reported on Sunday. California lies on the San Andreas Fault, which forms the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, two of the large moving plates that form the Earth's crust. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and subsequent fires devastated the city. In 1989, a powerful earthquake struck San Francisco, killing more than 60 people and injuring hundreds."

A spokesperson confirmed most investigations would be dealt with by a \"default\" team, but said that did not rule out local officers being involved. Critics have raised concerns that fewer officers will be investigating crimes. The changes are part of Leicestershire Police's bid to reduce spending by \u00c2\u00a330m. Under the plans, the force is also reducing the number of local units from 15 to eight and will cut 300 of its 2,200 officer posts over the next two years. Beat officers will now be known as dedicated neighbourhood officers to reflect the changes, which came into effect earlier, bosses said. Half of the 68 officers in the new East County team, which includes Rutland, Melton and Harborough area, will be PCSOs. Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey said the public should be concerned about the changes. He said: \"Because there will be far fewer officers investigating crime - more criminals are going to get away with it.\" Rutland County Council leader Roger Begy said he feared the changes would also lead to longer response times. \"We are a very low crime area [in Rutland] but we want to keep it that way,\" he said. However, Chief Constable Simon Cole said the force was \"putting officers where the problems are\". \"This transformation is the latest in a series of on-going changes in response to reducing budgets and changing public expectation and demand,\" he said. \"This new way of working will allow the teams based in our communities to dedicate their time to working closely with neighbourhoods and partners to resolve issues at a local level.\""

Dr Hinds, 35, from Tandragee, and his colleague Dr Fred McSorley were dubbed \"the flying doctors\" of Irish motorcycle sport. He was a consultant at Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh. He regularly worked at the North West 200 motorbike races in County Antrim. Dr McSorley told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster on Monday that an investigation into the cause of the accident was under way. \"John was not racing, he was riding his road bike. He was not in a race, we do not race,\" he said. \"He was travelling with the marshals after the race. He had been on the circuit that day. It was not a tricky corner. He was a highly skilled rider and we really don't understand what happened,\" he said. Paying tribute to Dr Hinds, he said his death was \"profoundly difficult for everyone\". \"In road racing, he was revered and adored by so many riders. \"But our thoughts also go to staff in Craigavon where he was revered for his wonderful work. He was a natural teacher and wonderfully inspirational. \"He was hugely dedicated to improving the care of critically ill people.\" Dr McSorley said Dr Hinds was exceptional. \"He not only saved people's lives but effectively, particularly with head injuries, he saved their brains. \"The fact they are able to walk and talk normally, get to work, pick up their children and give them a hug is because of the excellent care that he provided.\" Harris Healey from the Motorcycling Union said Dr Hinds was \"always a gentleman\". \"He saved a lot of people's lives in racing accidents and people had a better outcome because he was there,\" he said. Dr Hinds had led a campaign for an air ambulance service to be introduced in Northern Ireland and had met the health minister, Simon Hamilton, to discuss it. He said Dr Hinds was a \"lovely guy who will be sadly missed\". TUV MLA Jim Allister, who backed the air ambulance campaign, said the death of Dr Hinds was deeply shocking. \"He was one of our leading trauma experts. He was driven with a great passion to try and improve the chances of those involved in serious accidents. My thoughts are with his family. \"I do hope as a lasting tribute to him, the government will now push ahead with his ambition to have a proper air ambulance service for Northern Ireland.\" Members of the medical profession have also paid tribute to the Tandragee man.

Indeed, his recent promotion to the cabinet has had a major impact on his training for the 26.2 mile event, where the Vale of Glamorgan MP, the fastest in MP in last year's race, initially hoped to break 3 hours and 30 minutes. \"There's been a bit of a diversion over the last few weeks as well as an injury,\" he admitted. \"So I'm not sure I'll become the champion again of the MPs. And there is serious competition from Dan Jarvis, an ex-para, so I'm getting my excuses in early.\" Mr Cairns is running his 5th marathon for two charities: Breast Cancer Now and The Brain Tumour Charity."

      "text": "Some see in this the potential for a new era in Russian-French relations. Maybe not the strategic alliance of old, but certainly an end to the modern-day chill. Events have certainly moved quickly. A year ago France was in the middle of a nasty spat over warships which it was refusing to sell to Vladimir Putin. For France, the Russian leader was a destabilising presence on Europe's eastern borders. EU sanctions - intended to contain Russian ambitions in Crimea and Ukraine - had full French backing. Today there are more pressing concerns. In the wake of the Paris attacks, President Hollande had a vision of a single, united international coalition - the nations of the world working together to eradicate IS. Realities have since deflated that ambition. The Americans and the Russians are not going to work together any time soon. And the Turko-Russian crisis over the downed Sukhoi Russian warplane is a further complication. But still, the French want as many countries on side as possible. And the Russians - by dint of their military presence in Syria - are a major player. As one diplomatic official told Le Monde: \"Right now we are probably more prepared to work with the Russians than Barack Obama is.\" President Hollande has two goals in his talks with Vladimir Putin. First he wants to persuade Russia to direct its airstrikes away from the \"moderate\" Syrian opposition and onto targets belonging to IS. Second, he wants a firmer understanding that Russia will not stick indefinitely behind Bashar al-Assad. The French feel they have made a significant change in policy by de-prioritising the removal of the Syrian leader. It took a good deal of pride-swallowing to make the concession, because until two weeks ago Paris was President Assad's greatest scourge. But there is only so far that the French will go down this line. And they feel Russia should also give some slack. There are a number of factors in favour of a rapprochement. First of all, Russia has itself now come face-to-face with IS terrorism - with the destruction of the tourist plane from Sharm el-Sheikh. This has jolted perceptions in Moscow, for which IS is now a designated enemy. Second, Russia has every interest in cultivating Paris as a new friend. Straight after the Paris attacks, Mr Putin ordered his military to co-ordinate with the French in the campaign against IS - an unprecedented act given that France is in Nato. The Russian leader was effusive with compassion, and even sent a dog - Dobrynya - to replace Diesel the French special forces Alsatian who was killed in the raid in Saint Denis. It was all very deliberate, because there is nothing the Russians would like more than to lure the French out of the American-Western orbit. In the geopolitics departments of Russian universities - and some French ones too - this is regarded as a historically-determined necessity. France and Russia, after all, are two great nations lying at either end of the European continent - with a shared interest in preventing its domination"

Charlie Hunnam, who plays Arthur, said: \"One of my favourite places in the UK is the Highlands of Scotland.\" \"When I found out that we were shooting there I was very, very excited.\" The star of Pacific Rim and former TV series Sons of Anarchy and Byker Grove, added: \"The Highlands of Scotland are absolutely sensational.\" Hunnam made the comments in a video for VisitBritain, which has created a tourism campaign around the film. The actor's experience of filming in the Scottish Highlands was starkly different from those of other film stars to have shot scenes there. Scarlett Johansson described shooting scenes in Glen Coe in November 2011 for sci-fi Under the Skin as \"brutal, cold and wet\". At the movie's world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, she told a news conference: \"It was as if you had just picked us up and dropped us into the middle of absolutely nowhere. \"It was harsh and it was brutal and it was cold, it was wet and it was terrifying but we pulled through.\" Michael Fassbender and Paddy Considine told of battling the elements on Skye while shooting 2015's Macbeth. Fassbender, who starred in the lead role, described the island as \"cold, wet and beautiful\". Considine said some of the other members of the cast succumbed to hypothermia during the filming. He told the BBC at the film's Edinburgh premiere: \"It got pretty bad there.\" \"A few people got hypothermia. We got hit by horizontal rain. It came and hit you sideways,\" added the actor who played Banquo. Fassebender said the production encountered \"rain, sleet and snow - all the wetness of the elements\". Another actor, Noel Clarke, told of getting frostbite during filming for the film Centurion in the Cairngorms in 2009. However, the film crew for 2012's Bond flick Skyfall enjoyed themselves in Glen Coe and Glen Etive, and described being \"absolutely blown away\" by the Highland landscape and the sight of red deer stags."

Listening to the things we're going to do to change that, if people come down from now they will find a very different experience. \"The infrastructure is still well away from where it needs to be but there are plans to develop that.\" Cotton, 69, a former England and British and Irish Lions prop returned to Sale - a club he served as both a player and director - after Simon Orange's takeover of the Premiership side in June. He has promised to be active in his role, despite his commitments with his clothing business. \"What I really want to see is a very strong north of England club that can compete at the highest level,\" he added. \"That is my motivation for giving up the precious thing that I have got, and that is my time. \"I think what was lacking before was that the board weren't very often represented at games home and away, and I think that is very wrong - board members will travel to away games and home games.\" One of the standout announcements from Sale's new 10-man board was that director of rugby Steve Diamond will have a seat on it. However, Cotton insists there will be no conflict of interest with a member of the coaching staff also working as a director. \"It will put no strain whatsoever on the relationship, we're here to support him,\" Cotton continued. \"We'll be working very closely with Diamond to make sure we can achieve the ambition which we all hold - if we went down we'd still be with them.\" Diamond also confirmed they are close to signing a new full-back and are still looking for another player to add to their backline, with former Bath and London Welsh winger Nick Scott on trial with the club."

The bass guitar-playing, foreign policy hawk has had a media career since losing the nomination in 2008. He joins a crowded Republican field that includes three senators, a businesswoman and a neurosurgeon. \"Folks, it is a long way from a little brick rent house on Second Street in Hope, Arkansas to the White House,\" he said. \"Here in this small town called Hope, I was raised to believe that where a person started didn't mean that's where he had to stop. I always believed that a kid could go from Hope to higher ground.\" After announcing his ambitions, the crowd erupted in cheers of \"We want Mike!\" The former Southern Baptist minister acknowledged his pro-gun-ownership position, telling the audience about receiving a BB gun at the age of five. He said the US Department of Education should be abolished, a position popular with conservatives who oppose recent national education reforms. On immigration, he said the US borders should be secured, but was short on details. And he reaffirmed his steadfast opposition to same-sex marriage. Mike Huckabee is back. Eight years ago he launched a surprisingly successful presidential bid, finishing second to Arizona Senator John McCain and winning the Iowa caucuses and seven other states. Four years ago rumours abounded that Mr Huckabee was going to run again. Supporters and analysts watched and waited... and waited. The former Arkansas governor, who had a well-paying job as a television and radio host, opted to sit out the campaign, despite some polls showing him leading the Republican field. He said his \"heart says no\". Now, however, Mr Huckabee's heart is saying yes. He has quit his media commitments and is diving into the 2016 race. He'll meet a much more crowded field than would have faced him in 2012, however, both in the total number of candidates and in opponents who will compete with him for the evangelical voters who buoyed his 2008 campaign. Mr Huckabee has a lot going for him - name recognition, a developed fundraising network and experience from his previous presidential campaign. But given the strength of his Republican opponents - new, engaging and also well-funded - will that be enough? Early in his speech, Mr Huckabee noted that he was the first male in his family to graduate from high school. \"My dad wasn't an educated man, but he was a smart man. And he and my mother didn't have a whole lot, but they had honesty to the bone,\" he said. As his campaign gets under way, Mr Huckabee could face challenges within his own party. Many conservatives will not like the fact that overall, taxes and spending went up during his time as Arkansas governor. In 2008, Mr Huckabee won eight primaries in socially conservative states but this time he has vowed to focus more on the economy and national security. To win the Republican crown, he will have to overcome Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and"

First Bus inspector John Stewart told the FAI that Mr Clarke had blacked out while unwell at a bus stop in 2010. The inquiry is examining the bin lorry, its route and Mr Clarke's health. Mr Stewart told the second day of the FAI, which is being overseen by Sheriff John Beckett QC, that he was an inspector and had been with First Bus Glasgow for 12 years. He referred to notes he had taken on a Blackberry, detailing an incident involving Mr Clarke, while he was a bus driver, on 7 April 2010. The notes of his daily report from that day state Mr Clarke \"blacked out for a couple of minutes\" while at a bus stop having \"taken unwell\". Mr Stewart said he was alerted by a passenger on the number 54 bus that the driver had collapsed at the wheel. The witness said Mr Clarke was still in the driver's seat of the bus when he arrived at the scene, but there were no passengers on board. An ambulance was called and paramedics arrived to attend to Mr Clarke who was given the all clear and refused to go to hospital. He was not allowed to drive the bus back, which was returned to the depot by Mr Stewart. The witness said his involvement ended as soon as he left Mr Clarke and that he assumed the driver would have been sent to the company doctor. Mr Stewart, under cross-examination from Dorothy Bain QC, agreed that \"other people could be killed\" due to a driver being \"out of control\" of the bus. The witness said he did not know if a driver who had blacked out would be suspended, but he said he would not let them drive. Going back over Mr Stewart's report, it was noted that Mr Clarke had driven the bus to the stop he was at after blacking out. Mr Stewart said Mr Clarke \"should have used his common sense\" and not driven the bus, but said \"you would have to ask him\". Ms Bain asked Mr Stewart if knew that Mr Clarke was suspended from driving and had to attend doctor's appointments. The witness said he did not. The court was then shown a letter from a First Bus doctor saying Mr Clarke had suffered \"loss of consciousness\". In a letter, the doctor said Mr Clarke was advised that \"he does not need to inform the DVLA of the incident\". Ms Bain asked Mr Stewart if he knew Mr Clarke had reported passing out in a canteen at work that same day in 2010. The witness said he did not know. Mr Stewart said he could not confirm if Mr Clarke had been suffering from dizzy spells, but said he would have stopped him driving if he had. Mr Stewart will give evidence on Friday when the FAI resumes for a third day. Earlier, the inquiry heard again from Henry"

      "text": "Chuck Feeney is an Irish American philanthropist who has spent the last 30 years losing a fortune - but all in the name of charity. The 83-year-old businessman made his money selling luxury duty free goods to travellers across the world, but he rejects the trappings of wealth himself. He does not own a home or a car, and famously wears a watch that was bought for just $15 (\u00c2\u00a39). Mr Feeney is the founder of The Atlantic Philanthropies, an international organisation set up to distribute his fortune to good causes and projects that he supports around the world. Since he set it up in 1982, his foundation has made grants totalling $6.5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.9bn). His money has supported projects in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, United States, Australia, Bermuda, South Africa and Vietnam. The foundation's main areas of interest are health, education, reconciliation and human rights. Mr Feeney traces his family history back to County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland, where his grandmother was brought up close to the village of Kinawley. The entrepreneur has a particular interest in supporting universities on both sides of the Irish border. In 2012, Forbes magazine described him as \"the man who arguably has done more for Ireland than anyone since Saint Patrick\". His philosophy of 'giving while living' has inspired other billionaire businessmen, such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and investor Warren Buffett. However, Mr Feeney is not as well known as some of his biggest and richest fans, possibly because for the first 15 years of his philanthropic mission, he donated money in secret. He emerged from anonymity in 1997, and since then he has promoted the idea that people who have amassed great wealth should use their money for \"a greater good\". Known for his frugal lifestyle, the billionaire is a self-made man who sprang from humble beginnings. Charles F Feeney was born to Irish-American parents in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1931 - during the Great Depression. His mother worked as a hospital nurse and his father was an insurance underwriter. He showed entrepreneurial skills from an early age, selling Christmas cards door-to-door when he was just 10 years old. As a teenager, he enlisted in the US air force and served with Signals Intelligence during the Korean War.

The party has claimed increasing the statutory minimum wage of \u00c2\u00a36.50 an hour to the higher \u00c2\u00a37.85 living wage would boost pay for 250,000 people in Wales by 2020. It added that the measure could create up to 20,000 jobs through higher spending in local communities. Calling for a Royal Commission to examine wider workplace issues, Ms Wood said: \"It would be an opportunity for communities, trade unions, businesses and the public to get involved in a conversation about the kind of conditions we all want to see for working people.\""

Mr Erdogan said Russia had no right to \"slander\" Turkey with such claims. Russia and Turkey have been locked in an angry dispute since Turkey shot down a Russian jet last month. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already accused Ankara of downing the plane on its Syrian border to protect oil supply lines. \"According to available information, the highest level of the political leadership of the country, President Erdogan and his family, are involved in this criminal business,\" Mr Antonov told journalists in Moscow. \"The Turkish leadership has demonstrated extreme cynicism. Look at what they are doing!\" he said. \"They have invaded the territory of another country and are brazenly plundering it.\" The defence ministry cited satellite images that it said showed oil tankers travelling from IS-held territory to Turkey. The trucks, it said, travelled to three locations - including refineries - in Turkey and some was then moved on to a third country. Russia said it was producing only \"part of the evidence\" for now and did not provide direct proof of their claim that Mr Erdogan and family were involved. US officials have previously said they have information suggesting Turkish \"middlemen\" were involved in the illegal IS oil trade. The Turkish authorities have made commitments to tackle smuggling on their territory. Despite the tensions, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said he is prepared to meet Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu at a conference in the Serbian capital Belgrade this week. Mr Lavrov said he was willing to \"hear what Mr Cavusoglu has to say\", in comments broadcast on the Rossiya 24 news channel. It would be the first time the men have met since the downing of the jet. Turkey said the Russian SU-24 fighter plane intruded into its airspace and ignored repeated warnings to leave. The two sides have important economic ties, and in the wake of the incident Moscow imposed visa requirements for Turkish visitors, and placed restrictions on trade with Ankara."

A French government spokesman said there had been negotiations with the Vatican over the appointment. \"France has chosen its ambassador to the Vatican. This choice was Stefanini and that remains the French proposal,\" said spokesman Stephane Le Foll. Observers say most Vatican appointments are confirmed within six weeks and that this long silence should be read as a rejection. The Vatican traditionally makes no statement if it intends to decline a nomination. Mr Stefanini served in the Holy See as a deputy ambassador in the French embassy from 2001 to 2005. He was described by the country's foreign ministry as \"one of our best diplomats\". France legalised same-sex marriage in 2013, despite opposition from the Catholic Church.

Her inquest heard she should have been diagnosed as having sepsis when she was admitted at 07.40 GMT on 27 February. She died 24 hours after being admitted to hospital. Blood poisoning or sepsis is a potentially life threatening condition that can be easily treated with antibiotics quickly but is often missed. Coroner Jacqueline Devonish said that while the cause of death was natural, Mrs Cope was not given the \"best chance\" of survival. She added it was \"not possible to say whether Mrs Cope would have survived if treated promptly\". The inquest at Poplar Coroner's Court heard the hospital was overcrowded that day. It had space for 280 patients, but there were 320 patients in the hospital at the time. Mrs Cope, an interior designer, was seen by a nurse who tried to carry out observation tests but could not complete them because of a malfunctioning blood pressure monitor. She took Mrs Cope to the urgent care centre where she asked a colleague to repeat the tests but this took longer than she had hoped because staff there also struggled to get a blood pressure reading. The hospital admitted Mrs Cope should have been treated earlier than she was. Ms Devonish said she would not be making recommendations to the hospital because it had already drafted a new policy to diagnose sepsis following Mrs Cope's death."

Judge Thokozile Masipa gave Pistorius a five-year jail sentence for culpable homicide, but cleared him of murder. His defence said it expected him to serve about 10 months, with the remainder under house arrest. His family say he will not appeal. The parents of Reeva Steenkamp told the BBC they were happy with the sentence and relieved the case was over. Prosecutors had called for a minimum 10-year term, and the defence had argued for community service and house arrest. Pistorius, 27, an amputee sprinter who became the first athlete to compete in the Olympic and Paralympic Games, killed Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. He says he shot her by mistake, fearing there was an intruder in his house in Pretoria. Ms Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, reality TV star and law graduate, was hit three times by bullets fired by Pistorius through a toilet door. Before he went down the stairs and out of court, Oscar Pistorius slipped off his expensive watch and handed it to a relative. It seems the athlete probably knew his sentence beforehand, which helps explains the subdued atmosphere in court today. This case has revealed plenty about South Africa - its gun culture, the strengths and inadequacies of its police and prisons. But above all it has been a simple story, about the rise and fall of a global icon. As the crowds and cameras drift away from the courthouse, what lingers is the sense of waste. Of lives and careers for sure. But of time too. A man and a woman went into a bathroom. Only one came out alive. As the judge made clear - the trial should have been over in a matter of weeks. Instead it turned into a tortuous, overwrought epic. Relief as justice is served Pistorius showed little reaction to the sentence other than to wipe his eyes before being led away to a holding cell downstairs. He was then driven away from court in an armoured police van to Pretoria's Kgosi Mampuru prison, where he was expected to undergo a medical assessment. It is likely that he will be held in a one-man cell in the hospital wing, thought to be most appropriate for the athlete's disability. Correctional services spokesman Manelisi Wolela told AFP news agency Pistorius was \"already accommodated at Kgosi Mampuru\". He could be released after serving a sixth of his sentence, or 10 months, for good behaviour. However, Dup De Bruyn, a lawyer for the Steenkamp family, told Reuters that he believed Pistorius would probably serve two years. Pistorius's uncle, Arnold, said the family would not appeal against the sentence. \"We accept the judgment. Oscar will embrace the opportunity to pay back to society,\" he said. He appealed to the media to \"accept the ruling of court and let us move forward in this process and give us some degree of dignity and privacy\".

The government has strenuously denied such allegations and insist they are on the path of reconciliation and rebuilding Sri Lanka's north. After independence from British rule, increasingly assertive Sinhala nationalists, resentful of what they saw as British favouritism towards minority Tamils, began to fan the flames of ethnic division. A Tamil separatist movement gained momentum during the 1970s when a number of armed Tamil groups emerged in the north and parts of eastern Sri Lanka. But in 1983 the insurgency was transformed after a brutal anti-Tamil backlash following the killing by insurgents of 13 soldiers spread throughout the country. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) emerged under the leadership of Velupillai Prabhakaran as a ruthless and highly effective fighting force. It came to run what was in effect a shadow state in the north and east. The group used suicide bombings and other attacks to devastating effect in the capital Colombo and elsewhere in the 1990s. It also killed high-profile figures, including Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa. After various peace initiatives and ceasefires failed, the government launched a final offensive in 2009 and defeated the Tigers. Until the final months of the war, the death toll for more than 25 years of conflict was estimated to be about 70,000. But the final phase, when the government and rebels battled it out as thousands of civilians were hemmed in to a tiny strip of land on the north-eastern coast, has been the subject of most scrutiny. Estimates range from 20,000-75,000 killed in the final assault, but a government estimate put the figure at about 9,000. A 2011 UN report said hospitals, UN centres and ships belonging to the Red Cross were deliberately targeted by the army. The government was accused of using heavy weaponry and UN images obtained by the BBC appeared to show shelling damage in a government-designated \"safe zone\" for civilians. The report also accused the Tamil Tigers of using civilians as human shields, saying the rebels shot those who tried to escape. It also said that the rebels positioned heavy weapons in hospital grounds. Sri Lanka rejected the claims in the report as biased and fraudulent. Critics say there has been little serious attempt to do this so far. The government appointed a Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, which cleared the military of allegations that it had deliberately attacked civilians. Rights groups dismissed the inquiry as \"flawed\". In September 2013 the government held elections for a semi-autonomous council in the island's Tamil-majority north, a move which it said was a significant step in the reconciliation process. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) won 30 seats in the 38-member council and now forms the first functioning provincial government in the north. The TNA's 80-year-old leader, Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, said the victory was a chance for everybody to \"think afresh about the future\". The overwhelming majority of analysts agree that in the"

Police Scotland said the crime, which involved dogs chasing farm animals, had previously been under-reported. It said 60% of this year's incidents were detected and the dogs' owners reported to the procurator fiscal. Most of the offences reported were in Aberdeenshire, Highlands and Islands and Lanarkshire. Sheep were the most common animal affected. Other animals involved included horses and cattle. In 79% of incidents, livestock were killed or injured, and on average this involved two or three sheep per incident. Most incidents - 70% - involved only one dog and in 73% of cases the offending dog was local to that area, with more than half of all incidents involving a dog roaming free and where no owner was present. Insp Jane Donaldson, Police Scotland's rural crime co-ordinator, said the rise in reports followed a campaign encouraging farmers and crofters to contact police about livestock worrying incidents. She said: \"Livestock worrying has previously been under-reported. \"Farmers were often reluctant to report incidents to police, particularly where there was a 'near miss' and no physical damage was done to their livestock. \"A significant part of the spring campaign was to get this message out to farmers and encourage them to report all incidents and I think that this is reflected in the increase in reported crimes. \"More accurate reporting has improved our understanding of the problem, increasing intelligence about the how, where and why these incidents are occurring.\" Anne Gray, policy officer with Scottish Land and Estates, said: \"We are very pleased with how successful this year's campaign has been and we will continue to support the initiative going forward. \"It is vital that livestock worrying incidents are reduced. \"No-one wants to see this type of completely unnecessary suffering and the higher the profile of these incidents the more, we hope, it will prompt the small minority of irresponsible dog owners to change their ways and ensure they know where their dog is at all times.\""

Unesco says the Niuheliang archaeological site, which dates back 5,500-5,000 years, was a burial and sacrificial centre in the late Hongshan period. State media described the recovery as the biggest operation of its kind since the founding of modern China in 1949. The date of the recovery operation was not provided, but the ministry said in a statement that 1,000 police officer were involved. The looters were said to be split into 10 gangs that were responsible for everything from the excavation to the selling of the relics, according to China Daily. Four archaeologists are also thought to be involved, the newspaper said. \"Artefacts are sold at a fast speed and traded frequently in a short time,\" said Cai Binghui, a police officer who was involved with the case according to China Daily."

Earlier, airport officials said that Mr Kucherena had given Mr Snowden the travel documents. The US wants him extradited for leaking details of surveillance programmes. Russian President Vladimir Putin has refused to hand him to the American authorities, but said he could stay in Russia only if he stopped leaking US secrets. Mr Snowden, whose passport has been cancelled by the US, has stayed in the airport's transit area since arriving from Hong Kong on 23 June. Who is Edward Snowden? Where will Snowden end up? Q&A: Prism He has requested temporary asylum in Russia, and said recently his favoured final destination was Latin America. Mr Kucherena visited his client at the airport on Wednesday and told a news conference later that the 30-year-old would not yet be leaving the airport. He said the application for temporary asylum had not been processed, and no travel documents had been received. \"He is not planning to leave for now. He asked for temporary asylum, which in the case of a positive decision is granted for a term of one year,\" said Mr Kucherena. The lawyer said Mr Snowden wanted to study Russian culture, adding that he had given the American books including Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. Mr Kucherena said Mr Snowden was \"anxious\" about leaving the airport. \"I hope that this situation will be resolved in the nearest future,\" he said. \"This is the first time Russia is facing such a situation, and this issue of course requires time for the immigration workers.\" The lawyer's account contradicted that of airport officials, who earlier told local media that the lawyer had handed Mr Snowden the documents he needed to leave the airport. It was unclear whether there had been last-minute political intervention or some other problem. The Interfax news agency quoted unnamed officials saying the American would be provided with new clothes before leaving the airport. After the lawyer's news conference, the White House said it wanted clarity from Russia on his status. Spokesman Jay Carney said Washington had already made it clear to Moscow that Mr Snowden should be handed over to face espionage charges. The Snowden affair has caused diplomatic ructions around the world, upsetting America's close allies and traditional enemies. Leaks by the former CIA worker have led to revelations that the US National Security Agency (NSA) is collecting Americans' phone records. On Wednesday evening, an attempt to block funding for the programme narrowly failed in a 205-217 vote in the US House of Representatives. The White House had lobbied Congress to support the surveillance. Opponents of the US, including Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua, have all offered Mr Snowden asylum."

      "text": "The Kidman cattle empire is Australia's largest landholding, encompassing some of the driest and toughest country Australia has to offer. Its story begins in the 1890s with Sir Sidney Kidman and his elder brother Sackville, who embarked on an ambitious venture that would transform agriculture in Australia. The two brothers wanted to grow livestock in the country's dry centre, supported by Queensland's channel country rivers - the Georgina, the Diamantina and Cooper Creek. The plan was that tropical rain from the north would deliver water needed for farming to flourish in this harsh environment. The Kidmans' ambition, wrote biographer Jill Bowman, was to establish \"a chain of stations that were almost drought-proof, places that when linked together would provide a substantial water supply\". Sackville Kidman died in 1899, but Sidney turned their dream into reality, founding the company S. Kidman & Co the same year. Today the business encompasses 19 properties across the Northern Territory, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia. It owns 101,411 sq km (39,155 sq miles) of land in total - that's more than 1% of Australia's land mass and larger than Ireland. One of its properties is Anna Creek, the world's biggest cattle station, which stretches across 23,677 sq km. The Kidman family has owned and managed the business for 116 years. But in April this year it was put on sale for a projected sum of A$325m ($232m; \u00c2\u00a3152.3m). On Thursday however Australia's government decided to block the sale to foreign investors. Selling so much of Australia's outback to foreigners would be against the national interest, Treasurer Scott Morrison said. His reasoning? Part of property is inside the Woomera Prohibited Area (WPA), a military weapons testing range in South Australia. The country's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said the sale was blocked on national interest grounds and there was no discrimination against any particular buyer. About Sir Sidney Kidman Kidman & Co's business focus has long been on growing grass-fed beef for domestic and international markets. Headquartered in Adelaide, the firm says it supplies about 15,000 tonnes of beef carcass every year to markets around the world. It is not clear if prospective buyers would maintain this focus, but there's no argument they would enter Australia's agricultural scene at a pivotal time. As the mining boom subsides and the country looks elsewhere for economic growth, the business of farming the country's vast land for meat and other agricultural commodities has never been more important. Mr Morrison indicated that the government may be willing to see Kidman broken for sale. So foreign investors may yet possess at least some of its vast cattle empire. Simon Talbot, head of the National Farmers Federation, told the BBC that opening up agricultural growth in northern Australian areas couldn't be done without foreign investment. Even where large agricultural properties were foreign owned, the produce grown on them needed be transported using Australian infrastructure and jobs would be generated for Australian workers, he explained. \"People are starting to realise that as the mining boom is over, agriculture could become the next pillar of the"

      "text": "Prof Rosie Woodroffe has told BBC News that ministers were creating an \"illusion\" of success to justify the policy. She was speaking ahead of a scientific symposium on controlling cattle TB. Ministers say their approach is supported by government scientists and leading vets. Prof Woodroffe, a wildlife expert at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) who carried out the scientific assessment of culling badgers to control Cattle TB on which the current policy is based, said the government risked losing trust on how it used evidence - not just on its policy on controlling cattle TB but also on other important scientific issues. \"When evidence is being cherry-picked and presented in the best possible light, it ceases to be evidence. It is fake science. \"When it comes to (other policy areas) such as climate change and bee pollination, issues that have a big impact on lives and livelihoods of people, it is important that we can rely on the government to provide good evidence that stands up to scrutiny.\" A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which oversees the badger cull, responded: \"England has the highest incidence of TB in Europe and that is why we are taking strong action to deliver our 25-year strategy to eradicate the disease and to protect the future of our dairy and beef industries. \"Badger control in areas where TB is rife is one part of our long-term plan, which also includes strengthening cattle testing and movement controls, improving biosecurity on farm and when trading, and badger vaccination when possible.\" Read also: Badger culls extended to Wales to stem spread of cattle TB Defra has overseen the issuing of licences to cull badgers in 10 areas in South West England to reduce the incidence of TB in cattle. The first culls began in 2013 in two areas in Somerset and Gloucestershire amid criticism from many scientists that the policy would at best have only a marginal effect on the spread of the disease and possibly increase the spread of TB. The critics' comments stem from an eight-year trial carried out by Prof Woodroffe in the 1990s which showed that only sustained and coordinated culling of badgers can slow down the rate of increase in cattle becoming infected with TB in the immediate area. Crucially, the trial also showed that if less than 70% of badgers are killed, the incidence of TB will not be reduced and may even increase because of the greater movement of badgers caused by the disturbance of culling. Since then Defra's own monitoring has concluded that it has killed enough badgers in its pilot culls and has rolled out culls in eight more areas. The department will also announce up 10 more areas later this year. But some scientists are concerned that Defra has changed the way it assesses badger numbers in a cull area and how it sets the target for the minimum number of badgers to be killed to ensure that its culls are seen to be successful. The previous system involved field work by"

Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. \"We're quite upset,\" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, \"but we had a great time anyway\". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. \"It was kind of frightening,\" he said. \"When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. \"But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire.\" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music. Plus, they have really catchy choruses.

The shape of the planet's orbit around the Sun would be conducive now, they find, but the amount of carbon dioxide currently in the air is far too high. Earth is set for a prolonged warm phase, they tell the journal Nature. \"In theory, the next ice age could be even further into the future, but there is no real practical importance in discussing whether it starts in 50,000 or 100,000 years from now,\" Andrey Ganopolski from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said. \"The important thing is that it is an illustration that we have a geological power now. We can change the natural sequence of events for tens of thousands of years,\" he told BBC News. Earth has been through a cycle of ice ages and warm periods over the past 2.5 million years, referred to as the Quaternary Period. This has seen ice sheets come and go. At its maximum extent, the last glaciation witnessed a big freeze spread over much of North America, northern Europe, Russia and Asia. In the south, a vast expanse of what are now Chile and Argentina were also iced up. A fundamental parameter determining what dips Earth into an ice age is the changing nature of its orbit around the Sun. The passage around the star is not a perfect circle and over time our planet's axis of rotation also rocks back and forth. These movements alter the amount of solar radiation falling on the Earth's surface, and if a critical threshold is reached in mid latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere then a glaciation can be initiated. Dr Ganopolski colleagues confirm this in their modelling but show also the role played by the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And one of their findings is that Earth probably missed the inception by only a narrow margin a few hundred years ago, just before the industrial revolution took hold. \"We are now in a period when our (northern) summer is furthest from the Sun,\" the Potsdam researcher explained. \"Under normal circumstances, the interglacial would be terminated, and a new ice age would start. So, in principle, we are in the perfect conditions from an astronomical point of view. If we had a CO2 concentration of 240 parts per million (200 years ago) then an ice age could start, but luckily we had a concentration that was higher, 280ppm.\" Today, industrial society has taken that concentration to over 400ppm. The team says that an interglacial climate would probably have been sustained anyway for at least 20,000 years, and, very probably, for 50,000 years, even if CO2 had stayed at its eighteenth century level. But the almost 500 gigatonnes of carbon that has been released since the Industrial Revolution means we will likely miss the next best astronomical entry point into a glaciation, and with a further 500 gigatonnes of emissions the \"probability of glacial inception during the next 100,000 years is notably reduced\", the scientists"

      "text": "Scientists in Australia said urban areas were expanding rapidly in a complex \"non-linear\" way that existing models failed to capture effectively. Assessments needed to be modified if ecologists were to get an accurate picture of the environment, they added. The findings appear in the Trends in Ecology and Evolution journal. \"Our paper aims to raise the awareness that the ingrained perception in ecology that urbanisation intensity and age - and associated environmental changes - vary in a [uniform manner] from the core to the city fringes, does not apply easily to contemporary patterns of urbanisation,\" said co-author Cristina Ramalho, a researcher from the University of Western Australia's School of Plant Biology. \"It is necessary, therefore, that ecologists adjust the way they think and conduct research to the reality of contemporary cities.\" She explained that, historically, cities grew slowly in a relatively compact manner, through progressive rings of urban development. However, Ms Ramalho added, contemporary patterns of expansion were \"markedly different\". \"Cities are growing very rapidly, they are increasingly expansive and dispersed, sprawling in... spider-like configurations across large distances, and embedding fragments of other land uses in the rapidly changing landscape,\" she said. Ecologically, this type of expansion was having \"dramatic impacts\". \"It is driving the large-scale loss and fragmentation of natural and semi-natural habitats in several countries and cities worldwide,\" she told BBC News. \"In countries such as the US and Australia, urbanisation is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss.\" The researchers said current models used by ecologists to assess urbanisation looked at this issue in a \"rather simplified\" way - such as using broad categories, including urban, suburban and rural. Ms Ramalho explained why this needed to be updated: \"If contemporary cities expand in a complex, non-linear manner, then the assumption that urbanisation intensity and age can be assessed based on a site's position along a linear urban-to-rural gradient can be misleading.\" She added that the measures also failed to adequately capture the effects of important drivers, such as landscape fragmentation and disturbances. She also said that the changing nature of urbanising landscapes were not reflected in systems that did not have a temporal dimension. The researchers suggested, as an alternative, that the impacts of an urbanising landscape should be assessed by looking at the changing attributes of a particular area, or the characteristics of a neighbouring landscape. \"Ecologists should move beyond the use of aggregated urbanisation measures and consider a comprehensive set of driving factors selected based on the characteristics of the study area and ecological question of interest,\" Ms Ramalho said. \"Ecologists should also consider the temporal dynamics of landscape change, and the effects of land-use history and time lags on biodiversity responses to on-going environmental change.\" By adopting such an approach would provide information that would help policymakers and planners, she added. \"A temporal perspective considering the fragmentation and land-use history can provide insight into the remnants environmental conditions and conservation value and, therefore, be used in prioritising conservation. \"Priorities could be, for instance, those remnants without significant land-use legacies and those that were recently fragmented.\""

But Milton Keynes Taxi Association said he should not have been selected as a candidate in Bradwell. Mr Bradburn has refused to comment on his role in the affair. The council revoked Kiani's licence last year after it was revealed he had been given a private hire licence by the licensing committee in 2011. A second committee lifted a suspension on his licence in 2012, despite Thames Valley Police having written to the authority giving more details of Kiani's convictions for raping and assaulting prostitutes in London, in 1994. Councillors Stuart Burke and Gladstone McKenzie resigned from the council's licensing committee as a result. Labour's Mr McKenzie has also stood down from the council. Subhan Shafiq, who had vouched for Kiani as a friend in 2011, resigned as mayor in August. He then quit as a councillor when the council released a report into the affair in November. Mr Bradburn had sat on both of the committees, before he lost his seat in the Bradwell ward in May 2014, three months before the scandal broke. As a result, he escaped much of the media inquiries that followed. When asked by the BBC if he would like to comment as to why he had allowed Kiani a licence, he said: \"Not at the moment, no.\" The council's report revealed Mr Bradburn told investigators \"everyone is saying [Kiani] was a risk but he has not done anything in the 14 years since his release\". He also told the council he was \"confident the right decisions were made. So were the other members, but their leaders told them to apologise\". But Dennis Edwards, chairman of the taxi association said it was \"unacceptable\" Mr Bradburn was standing for election again. He said: \"What he did was appalling. Why would anyone want to vote for someone who put them at risk?\" Cari Mitchell, of the English Collective of Prostitutes, condemned Mr Bradburn's decision to give Kiani a taxi licence. She said: \"It is this blatant devaluing of sex workers lives which makes us vulnerable to violence.\" Mr Bradburn will stand in Bradwell against Rachel Cadger from the Green Party, Conservative Max Chaudhry, Labour's Rachel Pallett, Katie Simpson from the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and UKIP's Cathy Kitchiner. Lib Dem Mr Burke is seeking re-election in Shenley Brook End ward, where he will stand against Labour's Binta Bah-Pokawa, Conservative Hiten Ganatra, the Green's Michael Gurner and Geoffrey Winter of UKIP."

It believes low inflation and a strong pound will keep an interest rate rise on hold until the end of 2015. The auditor also thinks the UK economy will see \"decent but unspectacular\" growth of 2.9% this year. Most of that growth will continue to be driven by consumer spending, according to the firm's forecasting group, the EY ITEM Club. It adds that spending power will be helped by average wage increases of 1.7% this year, overtaking its 1.6% average inflation forecast for 2014. Its latest report reads: \"We expect wage growth to overtake CPI inflation as early as April.\" \"Until now the recovery has been financed by a fall in the amount households save, but it appears to be moving to a firmer footing,\" said Peter Spencer, the club's chief economic advisor. \"The consumer upturn will be given a boost from real wages and rising employment, while investment is finally kicking in.\" Falling petrol, energy and food prices, driven low by a strong pound, will help keep the cost of living down for a sustained period, Mr Spencer added. \"We are set for a long period of low inflation as pressures from commodity prices... remain largely absent.\" With inflation under control and a stronger pound, the club predicts the Bank of England will keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% until the third quarter of 2015, at which point rates will rise very gradually. The EY ITEM Club also suggests the recent resurgence in the UK housing market will be dampened by tighter mortgage lending criteria, due to take effect from 26 April. It says the new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules, which impose stricter checks on whether borrowers can repay home loans, are \"crucial to keeping the lid on the market\", particularly in London. As a result, the report predicts prices will rise by 7.4% this year and 7.2% next year, slowing further to 4.2% in 2016 as the government's Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme ends. \"The FCA will assume crucial importance to ensure... affordability is scrupulously checked,\" said Mr Spencer. \"If these controls are rigorously applied this will eventually constrain London prices, and head off problems when interest rates rise.\" Meanwhile, the growing demand for labour should push up wages and could also see the UK overtake Germany as the country with the highest employment in the G7 group of leading economies, the group claims. It predicts the UK unemployment rate, currently at 7.2%, will fall to 6.5% by the end of the year and 6% by the end of 2015. The EY ITEM Club, also expects business investment to grow by 9.1% this year in another boost to productivity and wages."

EDF, 85% controlled by the French state, has struggled to find the cash for its 66.5% stake in the project. In April it pushed a final decision on the \u00a318bn plant back to September. Chief financial officer Thomas Piquemal resigned in April following an internal disagreement over whether to press on with the controversial project. However, EDF has outlined plans to raise \u20ac4bn, with up to \u20ac3bn provided by the French government. Credit rating agencies are due to assess the group in the coming days and their verdict on its finances will determine how easy it will be for the group to raise cash. Meanwhile, tough market conditions mean EDF is cutting costs and planning to sell \u20ac10bn in assets by 2020, including a stake in French power-grid operator RTE. On Tuesday the new chief financial office Xavier Girre, said the management was not considering spinning off any part of the group to raise money. Its latest earnings report shows it has reduced its target for 2016 nuclear output to 408-412 terawatt-hour from 410-415. The scaling down of its output reflects continuing problems at its Paluel nuclear facility in France where a steam generator collapsed during maintenance. Sales fell 7% to \u20ac21.4bn in the first three months of the year, with sales in the UK down 9.8%. The company said its earnings forecast for 2016 remained on track."

      "text": "If emergency departments are struggling then it is a good bet the entire system is under strain. That is because the A&E stats reflect not only the demand on the system - how many patients are turning up, but also can indicate how quickly patients are moving through the hospital system. So if there are very few beds available on the wards it creates a log-jam in A&E and patients have to wait on trolleys for space to become available. A knock-on effect can be seen in ambulances queuing outside. Problems are made worse if there are delays in releasing patients from hospital because a care package is not in place for them to go home to. That is why many argue making sure social services are properly resourced is a key element in trying to tackle the pressures facing the NHS. And then there is the impact on planned operations. If intensive care units, for example, are full then there are no available beds there for patients who need them to recover from serious scheduled operations. If that is the case - some elective surgery will inevitably get postponed. Late last year, the Welsh Government pledged an extra \u00c2\u00a345m to health boards to try make sure scheduled, elective surgery and treatments are more protected this winter. NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall said it was still too early to tell in terms of numbers but hospitals needed to ensure elective surgery was managed in a \"sensible manner\" as there was a duty to patients. Another interesting thing to note - sometimes the figures show that unscheduled care units actually see a greater number of patients during the summer months - due to trips, slips, falls, bumps and so on. But in winter the NHS often has to deal with more severely-ill patients, for example elderly patients who have breathing problems. These need much more care, spend more time in the system and need more support to get better. COMPARING WALES WITH ENGLAND Historically A&E waits have been longer in Wales than in England. Some experts argue that is because there is a bigger mismatch in Wales between the number of beds available and the demand for them. The difference might also reflect demographic factors - for example the Welsh population as a whole being older sicker and less well-off than other parts of the UK. It is not straightforward comparing Wales with the NHS in England, because the \"clock\" starts differently when patients arrive. For those in Wales, the waiting time starts being recorded as soon as the patient is registered inside the A&E department - or when the ambulance crew notifies the desk they have arrived outside. In England, the arrival time starts when the patient is handed over or 15 minutes after the ambulance arrives at A&E, whichever is earlier. Leaked data for NHS England seen by BBC News shows the figure reached a low of 75.8% on 3 January but had recovered to 82.4% last week. HOW DO DIFFERENT HOSPITALS COMPARE?

      "text": "There are also rumours that Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the leader of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), has also been killed in a separate drone strike in Libya although the group has denied this. Meanwhile, the United States deployed a special forces team deep inside Syrian territory last month which killed Abu Sayyaf, a senior figure within Islamic State. Killing jihadist leaders is an established policy, although its efficacy as a strategy is not always clear. The most famous example of this approach, of course, came with the raid to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. A few months later the wildly popular al-Qaeda ideologue, Anwar al-Awlaki, was killed in a drone strike in Yemen. The appeal of both men declined sharply afterwards prompting the view that killing terrorist leaders might be enough to force the global jihad movement into terminal decline. That belief has pervaded parts of US President Barack Obama's administration, which has pursued an aggressive drone strategy aimed at decimating much of al-Qaeda's leadership. The overwhelming majority of its most important figureheads have now been killed in this way, severely impacting the group's operations. For a moment it seemed as if the so-called \"War on Terror\" was won. Al-Qaeda hit back. When the group announced Osama Bin Laden's death, it asked: \"Are the Americans able to kill what Sheikh Osama lived and fought for, even with all their soldiers, intelligence, and agencies? Never! Never! Sheikh Osama did not build an organisation that would die with him, nor would end with him.\" A similar message of defiance followed the death of Awlaki when the group declared: \"America has killed Sheikh Anwar, but they can never kill his ideology.\" Indeed, the global jihadist current has not ended with the death of Osama bin Laden. Instead it has spread into something much more potent, particularly in Syria and Iraq where fighters of the Islamic State (IS) group run rampant. They are, ironically, the inheritors of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's legacy - the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq who was himself killed by the US in 2006. When Islamic State detached itself from the central leadership of al-Qaeda to pursue an even more aggressive policy in Syria and Iraq, it claimed to be following the true spirit of Bin Laden's vision. They defied his successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who had ordered IS to confine its operations to Iraq while leaving Jabhat al-Nusra to fight as the official representatives of al-Qaeda in Syria. The dispute between al-Qaeda and Islamic State has now given way to fratricidal conflict between the two groups and demonstrates both the limits and unintended consequences of killing terrorist leaders. Herein lies the dilemma. There is obvious utility in killing terrorist leaders. Their deaths offer huge psychological blows to the groups they lead and impairs their operational capacity. But there are clear drawbacks too. The vacuum left by the absence of terrorist leaders can also fracture the movements they leave behind, spawning even more violent and nihilistic offshoots.

Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: \"I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. \"We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. \"There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. \"They're a good side and they played really well. We managed to hold on and get ourselves to safety, so it was honours even on a flat wicket.\""

The classes in Cheltenham began last month. So far there are six pupils, but this number is expected to increase. Mr Court attended an international boot camp to learn the different stages of the sport which range in characteristics from defensive in stage one to \"aggressive and flamboyant\" in stage four and \"unpredictable\" in stage seven. The 34-year-old said fighting with \"an elegant weapon for a more civilized age\" was a childhood dream come true. \"My brother and I used to steal our Mum's bamboo garden canes to fight with,\" he said. The lightsabers used in the sport are all hand-made and are provided for use during the classes, Mr Court said.

He underwent two unsuccessful operations to reattach his thumb before doctors opted to relocate his big toe in surgery lasting eight hours. Mr Mitchell said fellow workers had attempted to preserve his thumb immediately after the accident. \"They put it in the esky [cooler] with some ice,\" he told the BBC. Mr Mitchell was flown to hospital in the state capital of Perth, but efforts to save his thumb ultimately failed. Despite initial reluctance, the cattle worker agreed to the transplant operation at the Sydney Eye Hospital two weeks ago. Lead plastic surgeon Dr Sean Nicklin said he was not surprised it took time to accept. \"It is a bit of a crazy idea - they [patients] do not want to be injured in another part of their body,\" he said. \"[However] even if you have got four good fingers, if you do not have something to pinch against them, your hand has lost a huge amount of its function.\" Mr Mitchell will need more than 12 months of rehabilitation, but he plans to return to farm work. The Sydney Eye Hospital said it was rare to transplant a complete toe, like in Mr Mitchell's case, although partial toe relocations were more common. \"A lot of people think their balance and walking is going to be significantly affected which it generally isn't,\" Dr Nicklin said. Mr Mitchell's mum, Karen, said he was making a good recovery. \"Two weeks since the operation his walking is almost back to normal.\" Doctors say Mr Mitchell should eventually be able to return to his hobby of bull riding.

They did get compensation, but they say it is now running out. Some victims now rely entirely on benefits. Because they could not return to work due to their injuries, they have not built up work-based pension savings. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is presently preparing a bill to go through Stormont to put a special pension in place for them. Current victims' legislation in Northern Ireland from 2006 does not judge how someone became injured. It is argued that means former paramilitaries should be eligible to get this pension if their injuries are serious enough. It is thought 10 former paramilitaries fall into this category. More could come forward if the pension scheme goes ahead. But the DUP say their proposed bill does not need to rely on that current definition of a victim. They plan to exclude anyone with a terrorist conviction. Ernie Wilson was a school bus driver and member of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). In 1988, his bus was blown up by the IRA in Lisnaskea. He suffered injuries to his legs and eyes. He says no paramilitaries should be entitled to the proposed victims' pension. \"My message is pay the people that have been injured by the terrorists. Full stop. \"I know the men that are injured have to live, they have to get food, they have to get clothed, they have to be looked after. \"But they should not be getting a pension for trying to kill me.\" Yet the BBC's Spotlight programme has learned that the injured paramilitaries have support from some surprising quarters. Paul Gallagher was 21 when the loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) took over his house with the aim of killing a republican who lived nearby. When they could not find their target, they shot Paul six times. He was left paralysed from the waist down. He told Spotlight that allowing injured paramilitaries to avail of the pension was a price worth paying. \"It's a tough one. Say somebody was seriously injured, even by their own hand, they have needs now. So, I mean, they need to be looked after. \"If they go forward to the NHS they are not going to be turned away at the door. \"So why should they be turned away at the door of maybe the victims and survivors' service or other sorts of services? \"For me, it is as simple as just looking at human suffering really as the qualification for eligibility or even to be recognised as a victim.\" Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in told Spotlight they would not support the DUP bill if former paramilitaries are to be excluded. Spotlight was broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland on Tuesday 2 June, and is available on the iPlayer."

He had previously been manager of both Scunthorpe United and Brighton. During his playing career, he was a wing-half for Matt Busby's United, then Leeds before finishing at Scunthorpe. As one of the Busby Babes, he made his first team breakthrough at Old Trafford following the Munich Air Disaster in 1958. He played in the first game after Munich, just a fortnight later, when the team-sheet in the programme was famously left blank for the club's FA Cup fifth-round win over Sheffield Wednesday. And he was in the rebuilt United team all the way to Wembley, where they lost 2-0 to local rivals Bolton Wanderers. Heywood-born Goodwin also played first-class cricket over two summers, making 11 appearances as a fast bowler for his native Lancashire, in which he took a career-best 5-35 against Middlesex at Lord's in June 1955. After leaving Birmingham in 1975, Goodwin took up an offer to move to the then burgeoning North American Soccer League, where he had two spells as coach, then club president of the Minnesota Kicks. He remained in the United States for the rest of his life, and died at home in Gig Harbor, Washington State at the weekend.

Prosecutor Nicholas Lumley QC said in his opening statement Tommy Lee was left in the care of Mr Laverick at his flat on Linnaeus Street, Hull. He also told the court Mr Laverick had killed his son by shaking or throwing him. The jury was shown CCTV footage of Mr Laverick taking Tommy Lee to a relative's house to find the baby's mother, Kelly Whitworth, before the couple ran with the child to the nearby Hull Royal Infirmary. Mr Laverick gave different accounts of what had happened, including saying that he had fallen over while carrying the child, the prosecution said. A recording of Mr Laverick speaking to Tommy Lee's mother at a police station and made without their knowledge was also played in court. In it Mr Laverick described falling over in the hallway of their flat while carrying the baby. The forensic pathologist who carried out the post mortem examination on the body of Tommy Lee said he had suffered serious bleeding around his brain and the back of his eyes. The case continues."

Let's see. I hope for the time it's going to come up.

The NPS is the world's third-largest pension scheme. It comes amid President Park Geun-hye's impeachment over the scandal involving her longstanding mentor Choi Soon-sil. In the latest arrest, investigators are looking into NPS's support of an $8bn (\u00a36.5bn) merger between two Samsung Group affiliates and whether Mr Moon used his influence as health minister at the time, to pressure it to back the deal. The Ministry of Health and Welfare runs the pension service, which manages 545 trillion won ($451bn; \u00a3367bn) and was a major shareholder in Cheil Industries Inc and Samsung C&T Corp when they merged. The NPS has denied previous reports that Mr Moon pressured the organisation to back the deal, and Mr Moon told reporters on Tuesday that he would cooperate with the investigation. The scandal has also caught Samsung up in allegations that it backed foundations controlled by Choi Soon-sil in the hope of receiving political favours, which investigators are also examining. Politicians voted on 9 December to impeach President Park - a decision South Korea's constitutional court has six months to uphold or overturn. Until then she remains formally president but stripped of her powers, which are handed to the prime minister, a presidential appointee. Ms Park denies wrongdoing but has apologised for the way she managed her relationship with Ms Choi, who also denies committing criminal offences."

      "text": "Quite simply, if the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. If it is negative it is contracting. And two consecutive three-month periods of contraction mean an economy is in recession. GDP can be measured in three ways: In theory all three approaches should produce the same number. In the UK the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes one single measure of GDP which, apart from the first estimate, is calculated using all three ways of measuring. Usually the main interest in the UK figures is in the quarterly change in GDP in real terms, that is after taking into account changes in prices (inflation). Calculating a GDP estimate for all three measures is a huge undertaking every three months. The output measure alone - which is considered the most accurate in the short term - involves surveying tens of thousands of UK firms. The main sources used for this are ONS surveys of manufacturing and service industries. Information on sales is collected from 6,000 companies in manufacturing, 25,000 service sector firms, 5,000 retailers and 10,000 companies in the construction sector. Data is also collected from government departments covering activities such as agriculture, energy, health and education. The UK produces the earliest estimate of GDP of the major economies, around 25 days after the quarter in question. This provides policymakers with an early, or \"flash\", estimate of the real growth in economic activity. It is quick, but only based on the output measure. At that stage only about 40% of the data is available, so this figure is revised as more information comes in. They are two subsequent revisions at monthly intervals. But this isn't the end. Revisions can be made as much as 18 months to two years after the first \"flash\" estimate. The ONS publishes more information on how this is done on its website. GDP is the principal means of determining the health of the UK economy and is used by the Bank of England and its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) as one of the key indicators in setting interest rates. So, for example, if prices are rising too fast, the Bank would be expected to increase interest rates to try to control them. But it may hold off if GDP growth is sluggish, as higher rates could damage the recovery. That is the situation at the moment. The Treasury also uses GDP when planning economic policy. When an economy is contracting, tax receipts tend to fall, and the government adjusts its tax and spending plans accordingly. UK GDP is used internationally by the various financial bodies such as OECD, IMF, and the World Bank to compare the performance of different economies. The European Union also uses GDP estimates as a basis for determining different countries' contributions to the EU budget. The information in this article was provided by the Office for National Statistics."

Mr Li reportedly told his audience the vehicle was on autopilot and that the journey was smooth. Baidu, which has not commented on the incident, is one of many firms developing prototypes of self-driving vehicles that will use mapping and artificial intelligence technology. At the conference, Baidu announced that it had built an alliance with 50 partners to develop and promote self-driving cars. They include Ford, Daimler, five Chinese car manufacturers, mapping firm TomTom, and chipmakers Intel and Nvidia. Baidu said it hoped to have autonomous cars on China's roads by 2019 - so long as the law allowed it - before expanding to other markets including the US. Earlier this year Baidu also opened up its self-driving car codes to software developers via the 'Apollo' open-source platform in the hope it would spur innovation.

Ms Nawaz is due to stand for election to parliament in a by-election in her husband's former seat next month. He was forced to resign in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him from office for not disclosing assets. Mr Sharif denies wrongdoing. The couple's daughter, Maryam, tweeted that the cancer had been found on the left side of her mother's neck. End of Twitter post by @MaryamNSharif In another tweet she said doctors were hopeful of curing Ms Nawaz because the disease had been diagnosed early. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It occurs when tumours build up in tissues found in areas such as the bone marrow or lymph glands. Earlier reports suggested Ms Nawaz had throat cancer. Maryam Sharif is now expected to run her mother's political campaign while she undergoes treatment. \"We hope that she will recover soon enough, but it is likely that she won't be around during the days leading up to the election,\" senior PML-N party member Mushahidullah Khan told BBC Urdu. Mr Sharif had to vacate his seat after becoming embroiled in the Panama papers scandal. The papers revealed his children were linked to offshore companies that owned properties in London. Kulsoom Nawaz's decision to stand for election was seen as a change of plan for the family, who indicated originally that Mr Sharif's younger brother would run for the seat, and then the premiership. But instead the ruling party elected Sharif loyalist Shahid Khaqan Abbasi as prime minister. It has been suggested he will hold office until elections next year."

      "text": "The leaks from a secret BND report suggest that its monitoring station at Bad Aibling spied on France's presidential palace and foreign ministry, and the European Commission. The US National Security Agency also allegedly spied on some European firms. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere denies claims of a cover-up. The BND reportedly collected information on European firms at Washington's behest to check if they were breaking trade embargos. According to the reports, the BND did not target German or US officials in the surveillance, as they are protected by a BND-NSA agreement signed in 2002. However, it has emerged that the German government knew about NSA spying on European arms businesses as early as 2008. The government found \"shortcomings\" in the BND's operations, German TV reports. Minister under pressure - by the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin: Yesterday the tabloid newspaper Bild printed a picture of Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere - his nose elongated to Pinocchio proportions. \"Herr de Maiziere!\" the accompanying headline screamed. \"You lie with impunity!\" There's outrage here that Germany - for so long seen as the victim of American espionage - may have helped US spies to target other Europeans. And pressure is building on the government to reveal how much it knew. As the former minister in charge of the chancellery, Thomas de Maiziere was directly responsible for Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the BND, in 2008. And that is when, it's claimed, the BND first told the chancellery that its agents were now helping the NSA to spy on European aviation, aerospace and defence companies. Mr de Maiziere has denied all knowledge, and maintains that he hasn't deceived anyone. But he says that - because the information is all classified - he is unable to comment publicly. Yet there are questions about who else was aware. Another German newspaper devoted its front page to a \"wanted\" poster. Among the mugshots of politicians and civil servants was Chancellor Angela Merkel herself. Spy scandal turns tables on German government Mr de Maiziere denies having had any knowledge of malpractice at German intelligence. But he called for the internal BND report to be presented to a parliamentary committee, \"the sooner the better\". The huge scale of NSA surveillance in Europe - including joint spying operations with the UK's GCHQ - was revealed in 2013 by US whistleblower Edward Snowden. There was outrage in Germany because of the scope of NSA spying, which allegedly included snooping on Chancellor Merkel's mobile phone conversations. The revelations strained German-US diplomatic ties. Last July Germany expelled a CIA official based at the US embassy, as reports surfaced of several Germans having spied for the NSA. Germany's leftist Die Linke party accused the German government on Wednesday of \"lying\" in connection with NSA activities. German media reports speak of NSA attempts to spy on Airbus and Eurocopter, now known as Airbus Helicopters, via the BND."

It sparked a wave of condemnation and soul-searching on China's social networking sites. Doctors had earlier said Wang Yue, who had been in a coma since the incident on 13 October, was unlikely to survive. Anger and debate over toddler Police have detained the drivers of both vehicles involved in the incident, which happened in the city of Foshan in southern Guangdong Province. Wang Yue was knocked down by a van while wandering through a market, where her parents run a shop. The driver sped off without checking on the girl's condition. Over the following minutes, 18 people walked past the bleeding toddler, and another van ran over her legs, but no-one stopped to help. The distressing footage was shown on television. A rubbish collector who finally moved the toddler to the side of the street was hailed as a national hero, but the incident led many online commentators to question the state of Chinese morality. By Martin PatienceBBC News, Foshan Other than the two chalk circles marked \"1\" and \"2\" on the road, there was little to suggest anything out of the ordinary. The hardware stores selling irons, light fittings and taps were all open. Shopkeepers sat around chatting to each other. But what happened on a covered street of this huge wholesale market last week shocked China. A shopkeeper close to where the incident took place said she had been sickened when she saw the footage. \"Every time I watch it, my heart breaks,\" said Hu Haiou. \"I catch the news every night to see if she'll survive. The people who walked by were shameful.\" Another shopkeeper, Chen Guilin, said it had been raining hard the night of the incident. \"The raindrops sounded like drumbeats on the roof,\" she said, \"We had no idea what happened outside.\" Passers-by were 'shameful' A spokesman for the hospital told the AFP news agency that Wang Yue had died of \"systemic organ failure\", adding that no expense had been spared to try to save the girl, whose parents are migrant workers. There have been millions of internet comments about how to encourage good Samaritans - and many more expressing outrage that so many people refused to help. Her death was one of the most remarked on topics on China's Weibo - a micro-blogging site similar to Twitter - on Friday as people expressed sorrow and anger over the incident. \"Farewell to little Wang Yue. There are no cars in heaven,\" wrote one micro-blogger. Guangdong province is debating the introduction of a law to force people to help others in obvious distress. Initial online polls, though, suggest most people are against it. \"Talk about being civilised first. Is anyone paying attention to that?\" read one posting. Organisations in Guangdong are also looking at other ways to encourage people to act with compassion when faced with an emergency.

The maximum prison sentence will rise from 50 to 140 years for those who kill their victims. Kidnappings committed by a public security official, such as a member of the police or military, will be punished with up to 100 years in prison. Kidnappers will also have to pay heavy fines. In reality, few people ever receive sentences longer than 60 years for federal crimes, but kidnapping is considered in a separate category. The number of kidnappings reported to the police has risen dramatically in Mexico in recent years. In 2007, 438 kidnappings were reported, but the number had risen to almost 1,700 last year. And the government estimates the number of kidnappings reported to the police could be fewer than 2% of the total. If that is the case, the real number of abductions could be about 105,000 per year. Analysts say accurate figures are hard to come by, as many abductions only last for hours or a few days until the victims empty their bank accounts at gunpoint or pay a ransom. Most are never reported to the authorities for fear of reprisals from the criminal gang which carried out the kidnapping. In January this year the Mexican government launched a nationwide effort to fight kidnapping. A federal prosecutor, Renato Sales, was named to head an anti-kidnapping committee that would co-ordinate efforts to fight abductions in the 10 Mexican states (out of 31) where 74% of all kidnappings take place. \"Mexico needs to deal quickly and efficiently with the humanitarian emergency that this crime entails,\" said Mr Sales at the time."

Wales' Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said numbers were encouraging and the change had been \"good news\". In 2016, up to September, there were 42 deceased organ donors, broadly in line with previous years. A woman who had a double-lung transplant last Christmas has written an emotional thank-you letter to her donor's family - as Wales marks the anniversary of a major new law. Although numbers of donors naturally fluctuate year on year, the Welsh Government says it is confident that earlier hopes of a 25% increase in the number of donors will be reached in future. \"There's a much greater awareness of organ donation itself,\" Mr Gething said. \"More people are having those conversations with their loved ones about whether they want to opt in or to simply leave it as a point of deemed consent. \"It makes a real difference then to have that conversation at that point in time when it becomes a possibility and makes it much easier for health staff too.\" He said on its own measures it had been a success but there was still more to be done and it could be several years before the full impact of the law change was apparent. 160 organ transplants in Wales 39 organs from patients under deemed consent 226 patients on transplant list - Sept 2016 6% have opted out of the system Consultant Dr Chris Hingston, clinical lead for organ donation at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, said: \"We've seen a big impact at the bedside in terms of families approaching us to ask about organ donation, but equally families when we asked them if their loved ones wished to become a donor actually know the wishes. \"Even if that's not to become a donor, so they're refusing, but they're confident that that's the right decision for their loved ones. \"As a clinician that's all I ever wanted - that there wasn't a grey area where there's indecision and difficulty for families.\" Bill, 67, [whose surname we are not using] was admitted to the critical care unit at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff after suffering a stroke and a fall. His daughter Karen said: \"Dad had talked about organ donation. \"It's the last serious conversation that we'd had, not knowing that in a few weeks time, that was going to have to happen. \"It was his decision and I wasn't going to challenge it because it was his decision. \"I think I would have coped with it a lot worse if I hadn't have had the transplant to focus on. \"It's like he still had a job to do, even though he couldn't do anything, he was still doing something. \"He was looking after those organs before they could be given to somebody else. \"It's made losing him easier, because it's like something good has come out of it, and I can't think of any"

      "text": "The idea was discussed at a meeting between Justice Minister Caroline Dineage and parents who failed to receive the ashes of their dead babies. It followed an inquiry into failings at Shrewsbury crematorium. Glen Perkins, who formed the Action for Ashes campaign group, said Mrs Dineage had proposed a national consultation. It is expected to include affected families throughout England and Wales as well as industry experts. Mr Perkins - whose daughter Olivia died from sudden infant death syndrome in 2007 - described the meeting as \"very positive\" and said there was a willingness by the government to resolve the matter \"sooner rather than later\". He was joined in Westminster by parents from Leicester, Hull, Banbury and Stoke-on-Trent. They handed in a 61,000-signature petition calling for the return of ashes to be a legal requirement. Families were accompanied by Daniel Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury, who has secured a parliamentary debate on the issue on Wednesday. In a statement, Mrs Dineage said: \"Having heard the experiences of some of the families affected, it is clear we must do all we can to make sure this never happens again. \"No parent should have their grief compounded by a system that is supposed to help. The Emstrey report had a number of recommendations and it is imperative that we consider each one carefully.\" Last month, David Jenkins, who led the independent inquiry into failings in Shrewsbury, said he had been \"struck by the absence of authoritative national guidance\". He proposed the creation of a national inspector of crematoriums. About 60 families are believed to have been affected by failures at Shrewsbury's Emstrey crematorium between 1996 and 2012. Speaking at the time, Mr Jenkins said there was clearly \"no more painful experience\" than losing a child and that the issue of infant cremation should be treated as of \"the utmost importance\". A Freedom of Information inquiry by the BBC last year found the ashes of more than 1,000 babies were not handed to their parents between 2008 and 2013. In March, former Justice Minister Simon Hughes had suggested new national guidelines could be brought in by the end of the year. There was a real sense of positivity from the families that made the trip to London - a feeling they had done all they could to raise this issue. Now they are keeping a close eye on what happens next. I understand a consultation could start very soon and families are already being asked to register their details with the Ministry of Justice. Emotions were high when the campaigners handed in their petition. Five families carried boxes full to the brim with signatures. Glen Perkins, whose daughter Olivia died in 2007, was in tears on the steps of Number 10 Downing Street and that sums up the journey he and other families have been on. Other families put their arms around him as they posed for photos and then knocked on the door to hand in their petition. Of course it won't bring their child back and in many cases they will never know what"

      "text": "Mountaineering Scotland and the Scottish Gamekeepers Association have jointly written to Scotland's environment secretary. The Scottish government wants woodland cover to go from 17% to 25% by 2050. It said there would be \"appropriate consideration of Scotland's distinctive upland landscapes.\" Scottish Natural Heritage said Scotland had a low percentage of woodland cover compared with other European countries. A commitment to plant 10,000 extra hectares of trees between now and 2022 was made in the government's draft Climate Plan. But, in an unusual alliance, Mountaineering Scotland and the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA), said they were concerned about the impact of the Scottish government's forestry targets on wild moorland. The letter states: \"Our concern is whether adequate weight is being given to the significant changes this will have on the landscape of Scotland and in particular the dramatic open views and vistas which have come to signify to the outside world that which is unique about our country. \"Until a vision and strategy for Scotland's uplands is in place, there is an obvious failure to join up what is required from the land to meet forestry targets and what we might want to keep in terms of internationally rare and valuable landscapes and ecosystems.\" The two organisations are calling for an urgent policy statement which protects moorlands. Neil Reid, from Mountaineering Scotland, told BBC Scotland: \"It is a serious issue for both of us and that's why we have come together in this way. \"There are many things we do disagree about, and will continue to disagree about, but the key thing is that we both need a coherent policy and an overall vision for the landscape of Scotland.\" The group, which represents hill walkers and mountaineers, wants moorland areas to be left untouched as a wild landscape for tourists. Those tourists, they argue, are an important contributor to the local economy. Mr Reid added: \"They talk about this landscape, they don't talk about going for miles long wanders through woods. \"You can see the hills around you, you see the shape of the landscape and it's also relatively benign for walking across.\" The two groups have invited the Scottish government to share its thinking on the relative value placed on woodland and moorland. Gamekeeper Bob Connelly said: \"Heather heathland is one of the rarer types of habitat in the world. \"We, in Britain, have a very large percentage of it and to cover it in trees is just ecological vandalism.\" Both groups emphasise that they are not opposed to tree planting but that sites have to be well chosen. Ecologist Dr James Fenton, who has written a document called \"A Future for Moorland in Scotland\" for the SGA, has echoed the calls for moorland protection. He said: \"It's disparaged rather than being recognised as important so they'd be quite happy to get rid of our finest landscape. \"[We would] lose them by attrition, one bit is lost to trees here or a dam there or a wind farm there and we are just losing our wild, wide open spaces which characterise Scotland, and"

The children - who are European migrants - were removed by social workers who accused the unnamed couple of belonging to a \"racist party\". Council leader Roger Stone said it was launching an immediate investigation. The BBC understands that the three children are all under 10 and one is a baby. The education secretary said the \"wrong decision\" was made \"in the wrong way for the wrong reasons\". By Alan SoadyPolitical correspondent, BBC News There's been an outbreak of agreement from the main parties on the principle that being a member of a political organisation such as UKIP should not prevent someone from being considered as a foster parent. Michael Gove called it \"indefensible\". Ed Miliband said it should \"not be a bar\", distancing himself from the decision made by Labour-run Rotherham Borough Council. The investigation announced by the government and the council inquiry will seek to establish the circumstances of this particular case. But, politically, it will be interesting to see whether it has any bearing on political campaigning in the run up to Thursday's Parliamentary by-election in Rotherham. He added that the Department for Education, under his leadership, would \"ask the necessary questions\" to determine what happened in this case. Officials from the department are understood to be trying to make contact with children's services counterparts at Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council. Mr Gove told the BBC: \"It is entirely wrong for this couple to have been treated in this way. That's why I believe we need a full explanation from the local authority as to why this decision was allowed to be taken. \"If we say you cannot foster children because you're a member of a mainstream political party or because you have views on multiculturalism then that's utterly wrong. \"This decision is arbitrary, ideological and indefensible.\" The education secretary added that the government was bringing forward new laws in the Children and Families' Bill to reverse the current position, which takes into account ethnic and cultural factors when placing children for adoption. \"We want to make it clear that you should not allow ideological matters to preclude what's in the best interest of the child.\" Rotherham councillor Paul Lakin, cabinet member for children, young people and families Services has ordered an immediate investigation. He said: \"Membership of a political party should not stop someone fostering children. The council takes its safeguarding responsibilities very seriously and always puts the needs of the children at the centre of that care.\" Mr Lakin added he wanted the report on his desk by Monday morning. Meanwhile, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said that the decision may have breached the parents' right to freedom of political opinion. It welcomed the council's decision to investigate what had happened. The council's strategic director of children and young people's services, Joyce Thacker, earlier defended the decision, saying it was influenced by UKIP's immigration policy. She said: \"I have legal advice I have to follow for the placement"

He will face Tommy Robredo in Sunday's final in China after the Spaniard earlier beat Santiago Giraldo 6-1 6-4. \"Tommy will be a very tough opponent. I will need to play a really good match if I want to win,\" said Murray. It will be their first meeting since the Briton defeated him in the third round at SW19 last year. Murray's semi-final victory boosts his hopes of qualifying for the ATP World Tour Finals at the 02 Arena in November. The Briton, currently ranked 11th in the world, will rise above Grigor Dimitrov into 10th place in the race to qualify for the finals if he wins the tournament. He served 10 aces and converted six of nine break points in a performance that improved significantly as the match wore on. In hot and humid conditions, Murray fell a double-break behind at 4-1 as repeated errors, particularly off the forehand side, handed easy points to his 30-year-old opponent, who is ranked 97th in the world. A backhand that clipped the outside of the line allowed Murray to retrieve one of those breaks, but he immediately gave up his serve again, a limp forehand slapped into the net all too typical of his play. When another backhand sailed long, the Scot had lost the opening set in only half an hour. A lucky net cord and Monaco double fault allowed Murray to break first in the second set but another errant forehand conceded the advantage straight away. At 3-3 and break point down, Murray was in a precarious position but a swinging second serve allowed him to avert danger and he pounced on a poor Monaco drop shot to break for 5-3 before serving out the set. The second seed was in inspired form in the decider, winning it to love with his forehand now drawing gasps from the crowd as it repeatedly found the target and proved too powerful for Monaco to handle. \"The turning point was when we were 3-3 in the second set,\" said Murray. \"But before that he was dominating the match.\" Japanese world number eight and US Open runner-up Kei Nishikori made it into his second consecutive final, beating Finland's Jarkko Nieminen 6-3 4-6 6-2 in the semi-final of the Malaysian Open in Kuala Lumpur. He'll play fourth seed Julien Benneteau, of France, who knocked out the second seeded Latvian Ernests Gulbis 6-4 6-4."

Requests for content removal from other governments were relatively infrequent - the US made 11, with Germany making five, the UK and Russia two each and Austria one - bringing the total to just 186 for the six-month period covered. Microsoft received 3,546 requests for the removal of content from individuals and complied with half of them. The majority of requests are for the removal of links to search results on Bing, although the firm also received requests for the removal of content from other Microsoft services, including OneDrive, Bing Ads and MSN. Such requests were made possible by a controversial ruling from the European Court of Justice in May 2014. This allowed European residents to ask search engines to remove results for queries that included their name if the results were inadequate, inaccurate or no longer relevant. \"This new report illustrates how Microsoft strives to comply with local and intellectual property laws while adhering to our commitment to transparency and free expression,\" the firm said in a blog post. At the time, search engines worried that the ruling would mean they would be inundated with requests while internet rights campaigners raised concerns that the ruling amounted to censorship. All of the major search engines now produce regular transparency reports, partly in reaction to the revelations about government snooping from ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

The figures found: The IPCC said the figures also revealed \"marked inconsistencies\" in whether forces investigated most complaints formally, or used more informal \"local resolution\" processes. Dame Anne Owers, chairwoman of the IPCC, said overall the figures showed a complaints system that was \"both over-complex and inconsistent, and is clearly failing to satisfy a significant number of complainants\". She said: \"Chief officers and police and crime commissioners should look closely at the figures for their own forces to satisfy themselves that complainants are being treated fairly and well. \"However, the underlying problem is the system itself. We welcome the fact that the government proposes to bring in legislation to simplify and streamline a system that at present satisfies neither those who need it nor those who have to operate it.\" The number of complaints made to the watchdog marks the most it has received since it started collecting data in 2004-05. Det Supt Richard Lewis, Dyfed-Powys Police's head of professional standards department, welcomed the reduction in complaints, adding: \"It is important to us that people have the confidence to report complaints, and know that we have a thorough procedure for investigating and monitoring complaints.\""

Instead, they are the attributes with which Scotland's tourism agency is seeking to engage Scots and their spirit in making the country more attractive to visitors. There's a lot to do if VisitScotland and the industry are to hit an ambitious target. And it's one of the sectors that needs to succeed if Scotland is to turn around a formidable rise in its trade imbalance. The trade imbalance may not matter much, so long as Scotland is tied into the pound and part of the UK. But it is a useful indicator of economic health, and rather important to those who want to see another independence referendum. The Scottish government's figures for the whole Scottish economy have just been published, to cover the third quarter of last year, up to September. They show that, between July and September, Scots sold \u00a36.1bn of goods and services overseas. They imported \u00a35.1bn. That's a trade surplus, while the UK as a whole is running some very large external trade deficits. So that can't be bad for Scotland. But what about trade within the UK? Scots sold goods and services worth \u00a310.4bn in the third quarter to the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The flow coming the other way was rather larger: \u00a315.2bn. The trade deficit with the rest of the UK rose to \u00a314bn in 2014, from an economy with total output of nearly \u00a3140bn. John McLaren, a keen observer of these numbers, who used to work for Public Finance Scotland, observes that the first nine months of last year saw that deteriorate sharply. Roughly \u00a3750m less was being sold to the rest of the UK, and \u00a3750m more was being bought from it. The fall in sales success to this dominant market, McLaren points out, has real implications for prosperity and jobs. Exports and imports, overseas and to the rUK, combined to reach a deficit in the third quarter of \u00a34.25bn, the highest quarter on record. When the fourth quarter figures are published, the annual total is probably going to be above \u00a315bn. The previous record was as recession struck in 2008, at just under \u00a312bn. And it would mean that the imbalance has ballooned by \u00a36bn since 2013. McLaren has been looking at another angle on this, illustrated by these most recent statistics - the relative position of Scotland and the rUK in total output, or Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The third quarter saw that rise by 0.6%, after falling in the first half of the year. What, then, if Scotland were to have a geographical share of offshore oil and gas? Surely that would help? Well, no, it would show GDP falling by 0.8%, due to the falling prices of barrels and therms. GDP per head, with oil, was 1% lower than the rest of the UK. Two years ago, it was 6% higher. A more positive take on the figures is that GDP per head in the"

The Grammy-winning album produced the hit singles Black Hole Sun and Spoonman, and helped the band achieve worldwide sales of more than 20 million records. The re-mastered digital version of the album will be released this year to mark its 20th anniversary of release. The group, which reformed in 2010 after a 13-year hiatus, also played the album in its entirety for the first time at the iTunes festival in Austin, Texas, last month. \"We were touring at the time of Kurt's death,\" lead singer Chris Cornell recalls, \"and we just came off stage to be told of the reports that they had found Kurt, and he was dead. \"We were very emotional. All of the bands in Seattle had grown up together, we were all friends. I wanted to deny it, I didn't want to believe it was true. It was one of the most difficult things I've ever had to hear.\" Guitarist Kim Thayil adds: \"In some ways, I agree, grunge was already coming to an end at the time of Kurt's death. \"Sure, we released Superunknown that year, but all of us, the successful grunge bands, had left Seattle and were endlessly on the road. In the meantime the city was full of musicians moving there, wanting to make it in the industry. It was like LA during the '80s, the Sunset strip and hair metal. It had lost its vibe.\" In the past, Cornell has described Soundgarden, who formed in 1984, as \"the band that created the soundtrack\" for grunge music. Out of all the groups that formed in Seattle in the late 1980s - most famously, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Mudhoney - they were the first to sign to a mainstream label. But it was the release of Nirvana's Nevermind album, in September 1991, which put the city, and its then-unique style of music, on the musical map. \"I don't think there ever can be those conditions in the industry again to produce something like the Seattle band scene, of which Nirvana were the cultural event,\" he says. \"Seattle was an isolated and provincial place that was left alone for years to develop its musical scene. None of us had overnight success, it's not like suddenly one day Nirvana, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam all formed. \"It all changed after Nevermind, it became commercialised. Everyone wanted to discover the next big thing.\" \"I don't think the grunge movement was actually original,\" continues Thayil. \"It was just a a synthesis of different underground music genres. What made it original was the kind of people doing it - it was our extreme youth. I think most of us were trying to fit in with the rock scene in the city, but because we were also fans of darker music - British bands like Joy Division, Killing Joke, Bauhaus, The Smiths - our shows reached a"

The world's top-ranked bowler had a morning fitness test at Kingsmead but again felt discomfort. The 32-year-old will have more tests to see if he will be fit for the second Test, which starts on 2 January. The doubts over Steyn's fitness added to the problems for South Africa, who trailed England by 261 runs before the fourth day of the series opener and were facing a struggle to save the game. The right-arm bowler had only just returned to the Proteas side after missing the majority of their tour of India with a groin injury. South Africa have also been disrupted by speculation about the future of star batsman AB de Villiers. The 31-year-old, who is also keeping wicket during this Test, said on Monday that he was looking to ease his workload amid rumours he is considering retiring. \"There are a lot of rumours flying around I hear, but for the last two to three years the only talk I've been doing is to keep myself fresh and to have a bit of rest here and there,\" said De Villiers, who is ranked the number three Test batsman in the world. \"It's always been the most important thing for me to enjoy my cricket. It's just important to look at the schedule and for me maybe not to play all kinds of cricket. \"That's the only thing that I've been talking about. To keep myself fresh and to keep enjoying the game. I love representing my country and nothing has changed.\""

He led Hull to six wins from his 18 Premier League games, with relegation confirmed after a 4-0 defeat by Crystal Palace on 14 May. In a statement, Hull said they were \"disappointed\" by the departure of a \"firm fans' favourite\". The club were relegated in the penultimate week of the season and Silva said at the time: \"It's my goal as a manager to work in the Premier League.\" The former Sporting Lisbon and Olympiakos manager has been linked with Watford after the dismissal of Walter Mazzarri, but said recently he had not received an offer from the Hornets or any other club. \"Everyone knows when you have the chance to work in the Premier League, you don't want to work in Championship, it's normal,\" he said last week. A statement from Hull said Silva \"will be forever remembered for his efforts to maintain our Premier League status\". It added: \"Unfortunately, after considering his future, he has chosen to leave in order to further his career.\" Assistant head coach Joao Pedro Sousa, first team coach Goncalo Pedro and goalkeeping coach Hugo Oliveira have also left the club. BBC Radio Humberside sports editor Matt Dean: Marco Silva is undoubtedly a loss, although his departure isn't exactly a surprise. His drive, energy and focus for the job was unwavering and his values rubbed off on his players and the fans. He was always viewed as a coach bound for bigger things and brighter times. The club will be hard pressed to find another in his mould. Whoever gets the job will have to pick up the pieces of a squad shorn of six loan players now back with their parent clubs and be capable of galvanising those left, including the fans. There are no guarantees either that players such as Harry Maguire, Andy Robertson and Abel Hernandez will remain at the club. Fans will watch with keen interest to see how serious the club's owners are to get the club back to the Premier League with the next appointment and the resources allocated to them."

Its growth - and that of the wider economy - is all about external markets and it feels a UK exit from the EU is too much of a risk for business. It is not alone. Internal polling by three local business bodies suggests a majority of each of their memberships oppose a so-called Brexit. \"The uncertainty of an exit worries us,\" said Kevin McNamee, the finance director of the Denroy Group. \"It would mean new UK arrangements with the EU. \"If the UK has to renegotiate trade deals are they going to involve tariffs which impacts on our sales and competitiveness?\" But business supporters of a Brexit, such as William Wright of Wrightbus in Ballymena, argue the UK should see a bigger picture. Free of the EU collective, they say, the UK could strike its own trade deals not just in Europe, but in other world markets. Former Northern Ireland secretary of state Owen Paterson said: \"We have an opportunity if we leave to really expand trade in the wider world.\" Figures from the Department for the Economy reveal Northern Ireland sold products and services to the value of \u00a366bn in 2014. Leaving aside what we sell to ourselves (\u00a343bn), Great Britain is our next biggest market (\u00a313bn). Exports to the EU were worth nearly \u00a36bn and to the rest of the world \u00a34bn. It is those kinds of figures which are occupying minds in a good many boardrooms - if not necessarily the factory floor. \"You might get a different story there,\" admits Denroy's Kevin McNamee.

He is recommending that firms which have a \"controlling and supervisory\" relationship with their workers would have to pay a full range of benefits. That also includes millions of pounds in national insurance contributions. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Taylor - head of the government's review into modern employment practices - said that such people were not self-employed as many gig firms insist. \"If you are being controlled and supervised you are probably a worker and you should get workers' rights and also the employer that employs you should be paying national insurance,\" Mr Taylor told me. I asked him if such a relationship encompassed firms like Deliveroo and Uber, which say that their riders and drivers are \"self-employed\" and have full flexibility to work when they want. \"We do not mention individual companies in our report, but I think that if you look at some of the big gig work platforms, at the present time you would say their business models look as though it may be that the people who work for them would be classified as workers rather than as self-employed,\" he said. Mr Taylor said: \"If you look at the judgments that the judges have been making [about employment rights in the gig economy], it looks as though the courts are saying that it looks as though somebody is subject to control and supervision they should be described as a worker and not self-employed. \"Which, interestingly, is the same criterion used by the tax authority when they determine whether somebody is self-employed or an employee. \"We think that principle is right.\" \"Workers\" - which Mr Taylor wants to redefine as \"dependent contractors\" - receive a wider range of benefits and protections compared with \"self-employed\" people, including sick pay, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage. Firms which employ them are also obliged to pay national insurance contributions to HM Revenue and Customs at 13.8% of an employees' earnings above \u00a3157 a week. Although it is difficult to judge the economic value of the gig economy, more than one million people work in the sector. If large numbers of them are reclassified as \"dependent contractors\" that could significantly increase taxes paid to the government by gig firms. Mr Taylor told me that government tax receipts were negatively affected by the rapid growth in the number of \"self-employed\" people who pay lower levels of tax than fully employed workers. \"We have a big issue about the fact there is a gap between the amount of tax we pay on self-employed labour and employed labour,\" he said. \"If you go back to the beginning of the welfare state, that difference was about two-thirds - we paid two-thirds as much for self-employed labour as we did for employed labour - now it is one-third. \"And at the same time self-employment has grown. \"So we are creating a fiscal headache for ourselves, and one of the things we say"

When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. \"If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,\" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. \"We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,\" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. \"It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,\" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. \"We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,\" she says. \"I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once.\" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead \"is becoming more and more available - similar to cider\". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. \"I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,\" says Mr Alexander. \"You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.\" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers"

But he also raised concerns about possible damage to the site over plans to build a road tunnel past Stonehenge. The Department of Transport said it would \"consult before any building\". The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said \"scientifically tested charcoal\" dug up from the site had \"revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC\". David Jacques said the dig had also found \"evidence of feasting\" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: \"British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK. \"Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late 5th Millennium BC. \"But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead.\" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could \"provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge.\" Earlier this month, the government announced funding for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel to remove congestion from the main road past Stonehenge. A Department for Transport spokesman said: \"As with any road scheme, we will consult with interested parties before any building begins on the A303. \"English Heritage and National Trust are supportive of our plans, and we will ensure sites of cultural or historical significance are safeguarded as we progress with the upgrade.\""

A statement from the Ministry of Public Security said suspects included lawyers, social media celebrities and petitioners but that lawyers were the core. It accused a group led by the Beijing-based Fengrui Law Firm, of illegally hiring protesters and swaying court decisions in the name of \"defending justice and public interests.\" It went on to accuse the group of organising more than 40 controversial incidents and severely disrupting public order. It gave an example in which it had allegedly presented a legitimate police shooting at a railway station as a murder conspiracy. Since last Thursday at least six lawyers have been detained and more than 50 taken in for questioning by police in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, according to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. It is not clear how many are still in custody. Some of those questioned had signed a letter asking authorities to release Wang Yu, a human rights lawyer who vanished from her home last week and is now believed to be in detention. Ms Wang worked for the Fengrui law firm. Another Fengrui lawyer, Zhou Shifeng, disappeared the day after one of his clients was released last week. State media have confirmed that six people including Wang Yu and Zhou Shifeng are in criminal detention for \"seriously violating the law\". The People's Daily said Mr Zhou was suspected of serious crimes. It also attacked another employee of the firm, online activist Wu Gan, saying he had exploited his fame and exaggerated sensitive incidents for profit. Mr Wu has been in detention since May and earlier this month was charged with \"inciting subversion\". The People's Daily denounced what it called a \"major criminal organisation\" which \"seriously disturbed social order\". Last year saw reforms designed to make courts less corrupt and less embedded in local politics. There were promises to exclude tainted evidence, torture and coercion. But at the same time, President Xi said the rule of law would be \"a knife whose handle was in the hands of the party and the people\". Any campaign to promote the rule of law which thinks lawyers are part of the problem rather the solution is in trouble. But this is the direction of travel in China. Groups that cannot be co-opted become pariahs. And lawyers who assert a set of values outside the narrowing space allotted to them by the state are no exception. There would be no constitutionalism, judicial independence or separation of powers. And clearly no lawyers or law firms who put their client's interests ahead of those of the party. \"Such an unprecedented nationwide crackdown can only have been sanctioned from within the central government,\" said William Nee, China Researcher at Amnesty International. \"This coordinated attack on lawyers makes a mockery of President Xi Jinping's claims to promote the rule of law.\" Xi Jinping came to power nearly three years ago vowing to tackle"

As agreed with North Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Julia Mulligan, Mr Jones will remain in post until a permanent appointment is made, Ms Mulligan's South Yorkshire counterpart Dr Alan Billings said. \"I am confident that he will be able to move the force forward to a position where trust and confidence in the force can begin to be restored,\" said Dr Billings. David Crompton, who was due to retire in November after four years in the post, was suspended after what Dr Billings described as \"an erosion of trust and confidence in South Yorkshire Police\". Mr Crompton and the force have faced continuing criticism not only in relations to Hillsborough but also over its handling of investigations into child sexual exploitation. Mr Jones began his career in Greater Manchester and was Assistant Chief Constable for Police Service Northern Ireland until moving to North Yorkshire in 2013. He said he realised he was taking the post at a very difficult period and said he wanted to make a difference. \"First and foremost, I will engage with those communities both inside and outside of South Yorkshire who have been let down by the police service,\" Mr Jones said. \"I want to understand how their confidence in policing has been affected, and work with them to build it back up and restore pride back into the police service.\" He added he would be seeking support for a full review of South Yorkshire Police. The Deputy Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Tim Madgwick, has been named as the temporary chief of that force."

      "text": "Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said an innovative project has seen approximately 4,000 of the threatened crustaceans reared and released here since 2009. The focus is on the River Wye and its tributaries, the last remaining native crayfish stronghold in Wales. Some fear the species could die out completely by 2030. Crayfish are considered a key indicator of the health of our rivers. But numbers have been in sharp decline since the introduction of North American signal crayfish to Britain in the 1980s. Initially, these larger crayfish were farmed for their meat. But the non-native species spread widely, out-competing native populations for food and infecting them with a deadly plague. Oliver Brown, NRW's fish culture officer, said parts of the country had lost between 50 to 98% of their population of white-clawed crayfish. As a keystone species, the native crayfish's decline impacts on the overall diversity of water courses with knock-on effects for a large number of other organisms and habitats as a whole. The re-introduction project at Cynrig Hatchery, near Brecon, was designed as a \"stop-gap\" measure to avoid a total wipe-out in Wales. With help from local charity the Wye and Usk Foundation, the reared crayfish are released into specially selected \"ark\" sites, where they are protected by natural barriers from possible invasion by signal crayfish. Recent site visits have shown the juveniles surviving for at least two years post release. \"If we can create enough of these ark sites it should give us that little bit of extra time to find a solution to the issues,\" Mr Brown told BBC Wales. He added that there was growing interest across the UK in the work being carried out in Wales. \"It's an iconic species, indicative of a really good river habitat. If we lose it then it's the start of a slippery slope. \"But in reality we are going to have to come up with something pretty spectacular (to reverse the decline).\" Meanwhile, researchers at Cardiff University are hoping they can do just that. PhD student Rhidian Thomas is set to present his research on the invasive signal crayfish at an International Crayfish Symposium in Madrid this month. \"It is quite a grave situation - the non-native species are continuing to spread and bringing crayfish plague with them,\" he said. \"The main focus of the research here at Cardiff Research into Infection and Parasites in Ecological Systems (Cripes) is to try and understand which factors are associated with their success. \"We also want to understand more about the parasites and pathogens that get co-introduced with them when they're brought over. \"It's to try and understand what sorts of management practices we can put in place.\" One method that is increasingly being encouraged is for people who use waterways - such as canoeists and fishermen - to check, clean and dry their equipment after use to try and prevent the spread of crayfish plague from area to area. The NRW said getting the message across was \"vital\" as a wet wader or the underside of a boat that had been in contact"

Her latest creation, baked to celebrate the Defender model, fed 2,000 people at an event at the factory in Solihull on Monday. The half-scale replica weighed 600kg and featured working headlights. Comprising 32 sponge cakes, 50kg (110 lbs) of butter cream, 20kg (44 lbs) of ganache and 50kg icing, it took her 150 hours to produce. Ms Clarke said the bake was so heavy it had to be delivered by fork lift truck. \"We arrived by van and everyone was coming round to have a look,\" she said. \"They couldn't believe it was a cake. There was plenty to go round and everyone on the factory floor got a piece.\" It was baked to celebrate the two millionth Defender rolling off the production line - the figure includes its predecessors the Series I, II and III models. Ms Clarke said it started after she tagged JLR in a tweet about a small Land Rover birthday cake. \"They got in touch and asked if I could make a cake in the shape of an engine to mark the opening of their new engine plant. \"A woman then asked me if I could make a Land Rover cake. \"It was originally meant to be quite small, but I asked them if they wanted something that would really impress people.\" Ms Clarke said she was getting married in October, a week before the Cake International competition at Birmingham's NEC. Rather than enter this year, she said she planned to bake \"the best wedding cake that's ever been seen\"."

India, traditionally, has invited its Republic Day guests who will not attract controversy at home and come from countries with whom it has close strategic relations. Thus the heads of neither Pakistan nor China have been invited on the first count. While no Latin American leaders have ever come for the second reason. It says something about how difficult Indo-US relations have been that it has taken over seven decades for Delhi to invite the US president to participate in a ceremony marking its emergence as a full-fledged constitutional democracy. While there is much focus on what diplomats call the \"deliverables\" - substantive agreements and deals - that will emerge from the meeting, the likelihood is that the symbolism will be much greater than the substance on this visit. Mr Obama and Mr Modi held a fruitful summit in September last year and the present invitation was extended seemingly on the spur of the moment by Mr Modi when the two met on sidelines of the East Asia Summit in Myanmar (Burma) last November. This has meant, officials on both sides admit, relatively little time to put together a substantial agenda. A better measure of the Republic Day summit's agenda will be the areas the bilateral talks will focus on - defence, energy and counter-terrorism. These are all in the sensitive zone of most governments and the depth of the discussion in each of these underlines how close the two countries have become. In defence, the spearhead of the relationship is less the business of selling and buying arms than attempts by India and the US to jointly develop and produce a new generation of weaponry. This idea has been kicked around for several years between the two countries, struggling to overcome political and bureaucratic resistance within both capitals. The expectation is that at least one, if not more, such deals will be signed later this month. A few dozen possible technologies and weapon systems have been offered by the US. India is particularly interested in drones, carrier technology and so on that enhance its ability to project its air and naval power. In energy, the two governments are looking at contending interests - improving the supply of fossil fuels and inhibiting climate change. Mr Modi and Mr Obama are relatively unusual among world leaders in their personal belief that global warming is an issue of overriding importance. The US has thus been a strong supporter - though with some commercial opportunities in mind - of the Indian government's ambitious plans for renewable energy, especially solar. The September Indo-US summit was shot through with green energy. Mr Obama would like Mr Modi to give binding commitments on India's carbon emissions, even ones as broad as the ones China agreed to recently. But India has a troubled fossil fuel dependent power generation sector. It is looking increasingly"

Headscarf bans on university campuses and state institutions - except for the judiciary, military and police - have also been lifted in recent years. The garment has been controversial in Turkey for years. Secularists regard it as a symbol of religious conservatism. Since the 1920s, Turkey has had a secular constitution with no state religion. The opposition have accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP) of trying to reinterpret secularism. However, public debate has also evolved to accept the hijab as an expression of individual liberties, correspondents say. No strong opposition has been voiced against this latest move. President Erdogan has long embraced Turks' right to express their religious beliefs openly, but he says he is committed to secularism. In 2010, the country's universities abandoned an official ban on Muslim headscarves. Three years later, women were allowed to wear headscarves in state institutions - with the exception of the judiciary, military and police. That year, four MPs wore headscarves in parliament.

There are daily events but, certainly with the two main parties, the general unscreened public is rarely invited. Photo calls are arranged to provide the backdrop for a campaign. I am travelling with David Cameron's team. It is a campaign geared to exclude the unexpected, the random encounter. At events, microphones that could pick up a stray remark are kept at a distance. For the political class has bought into the narrative that Gordon Brown's campaign unravelled when an unguarded microphone caught him referring to a woman - Gillian Duffy - as that \"bigoted woman\". Similarly it was regarded as a defining moment when Tony Blair was ambushed by Sharon Storer who said to his face: \"All you do is walk around and make yourself known but you don't do anything to help anybody.\" But elections are rarely decided by gaffes or unguarded moments. That was proved by Ronald Reagan who, at one point, boldly declared \"all the waste in a year from a nuclear plant can be stored under a desk\". It didn't hurt him. When I was covering the Obama campaign in 2008 it did not fatally wound Barack Obama when he spoke of \"bitter working-class Americans who cling to guns or religion\". In Britain, the political rally, open to the general public, is all but extinct. The reality of the election trail is mediated through highly choreographed TV scenes. Party leaders are wary of crowds, of hecklers; above all they fear unscripted moments leading the evening news. Elsewhere in Europe, campaigning is more unbuttoned. They ride out the hostile crowd. I have attended large public rallies in Paris, Rome and Berlin. I have stood and watched an unflappable Angela Merkel in Darmstadt continue speaking against a background soundtrack of noisy horn-blowing protestors. In Milan, I saw hecklers interrupt Silvio Berlusconi; he paused and began bouncing up and down as if on a football terrace while his supporters drowned out the protestors. After almost every campaign-stop, Francois Hollande worked the crowd regardless of their loyalties. His predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy once even turned on a voter urging him, in rather colourful language, to get lost, you idiot. In the UK, the instinct of the major parties is to shun the crowd, the unchecked rope-line, the hidden dangers of the town square. David Cameron's strategy is defensive, to stake his claim on his economic record. His effortless charm - much admired by Angela Merkel and others - is replaced by a politician more tightly-wound. In private he remains easy and relaxed but in Manchester, at the debate, his camera stare was more fixed as if he had been told not to stray from his core much-honed message. It is a campaign built around the economy,"

The chief executive of exam board WJEC Gareth Pierce said: \"Students and teachers in Wales should be extremely pleased with the successes demonstrated by the results in both these new qualifications.\" Mr Pierce added: \"There is of course plenty of time remaining within Year 11 for those candidates who wish to aim for improvement on the grade achieved on this occasion.\" Schools started teaching the new qualifications in September 2015 and the majority of pupils will sit them, as usual, in the summer. The GCSE numeracy qualification assesses the maths that pupils will need in their everyday lives, at work and in other subject areas in school. More than 12% of nearly 29,000 pupils who took the exam achieved the very top A and A* grades. The GCSE mathematics exam involves aspects needed for scientific, technical or further maths study. About 10% of the 22,686 pupils who took this exam got the highest A and A* grades. Education Secretary Kirsty Williams also congratulated the students and said the \"made in Wales\" qualifications were aimed at raising standards by placing a sharper focus on literacy and numeracy. \"The new qualifications are part of extensive reforms to our education system to give our young people the right skills and knowledge to thrive in the modern word,\" she said. \"Our national mission is to raise standards and make sure everybody has a chance to succeed.\" They are being called \"significantly different\" from the old GCSEs, with warnings about taking care when comparing them with previous results.

Bolton's win took them into the automatic promotion places while Scunthorpe, top at the start of the day, slipped to third after Sheffield United's 1-0 win over Northampton earlier in the afternoon. Until Henry's intervention Neal Bishop's fourth goal of the season appeared to have earned Graham Alexander's side a deserved draw. Bolton, watched by the Macron Stadium's second biggest attendance of the season - 17,062 - led 1-0 at half-time. Josh Vela's half volley from the edge of the area after 17 minutes was his eighth goal of the campaign. Scunthorpe had a goal disallowed for offside but Clough wasted a good opportunity to double Wanderers' advantage and felt he should have had a penalty after Jordan Clarke's challenge. Scunthorpe were much the better side after the break and they deservedly drew level when Bolton failed to clear a 62nd-minute corner and Bishop swivelled on the loose ball to rifle home from 10 yards. But their endeavours drew a blank courtesy of Henry's hammer blow. Report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Bolton Wanderers 2, Scunthorpe United 1.

      "text": "Ministers have said it would be wrong to give a guarantee without a similar deal for Britons abroad, which they say they will seek in Brexit negotiations. But the Commons backed a Labour motion urging a rethink by 245 votes to two, as government MPs largely abstained. Leading Leave campaigner Boris Johnson was among several Tory rebels to vote against the government. The government had tried to avoid a Commons vote because defeat seemed likely - but Labour forced a division following its opposition day debate. The motion is not binding on the government but it acts as a signal of MPs' views on the subject. Mr Johnson supported Labour's call for ministers to \"commit with urgency\" to giving the estimated three million EU nationals in the UK the right to remain after the country has left the EU. He told MPs: \"I would like to set on record that countless times the Vote Leave campaign gave exactly this reassurance to people from other EU countries that live and work here and it is very disappointing that this is being called into question. \"It think it's absolutely right to issue the strongest possible reassurance to EU nationals in this country, not just for moral or humanitarian reasons, but very, very sound economic reasons too. \"They are welcome, they are necessary, they are a vital part of our society and I will be passionately voting for this motion tonight.\" Home Secretary Theresa May, who backed staying in the EU, has been criticised - including by many Conservative MPs - for failing to guarantee EU citizens already in the UK the right to remain. She has said the issue will play a part in negotiations with the EU, as the UK maps out its withdrawal. Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham accused Mrs May of using EU citizens as \"bargaining chips\". He claimed Mrs May was trying to \"woo\" Conservative Party members in her bid to become the next leader and prime minister. Criticising her absence from the debate, Mr Burnham accused Mrs May of an \"abdication of leadership\". But immigration minister James Brokenshire - who faced criticism from MPs across the political spectrum over the government's stance - rejected the claim it was treating EU citizens as \"bargaining chips\". \"In the approach the government takes and the agreements we make, we will never treat EU citizens as pawns in some kind of cynical game of negotiation chess.\" He said the government's aim was to secure a \"fair deal\" for EU nationals in the UK and Britons living abroad in other European countries. In a statement on Wednesday evening after the Commons vote, Mr Burnham said MPs' decision was \"a victory for common sense and decency\". \"With this emphatic result, it is impossible to see how the government can now reverse what is the clear will of the House of Commons. \"Theresa May should accept the decision of the House and confirm the legal status of EU nationals without delay,\" he added."

Nathan Redmond shot wide late on for the visitors but Swansea, whose head coach Francesco Guidolin missed the game through illness, held on to win. Norwich remain in the relegation zone and are without a win in 10 matches in all competitions. Alex Neil's side are now one point from safety after Sunderland picked up a draw against Southampton. Swansea have now secured back-to-back league victories after their shock win over Arsenal on Wednesday. Except for a low Cameron Jerome effort from range that was palmed away by Lukasz Fabianski, neither goalkeeper was tested in an uneventful first half. But Iceland midfielder Sigurdsson opened the game up shortly after the break with a calm finish that gave Swansea what was, in the end, a deserved win. He was also denied a second goal from a curling free kick late on by John Ruddy's finger-tip save. Norwich lacked urgency until the closing stages and pressed late on in the game, but Dieumerci Mbokani could not keep a header down and substitute Patrick Bamford saw a low effort saved. The Canaries remain without an away win since beating Manchester United in December. The second-half introduction of former Norwich midfielder Leroy Fer, signed by Swansea in the January transfer window, gave the hosts a fresh impetus in attack. It was his square ball that found Sigurdsson in space for the winning goal and, having impressed at the Emirates against Arsenal on Wednesday, he went on to put in a lively performance for the Swans. Swansea boss Guidolin picked the team from his hospital bed for a second consecutive game, as he continues to recover from a chest infection. Coach Alan Curtis, who has taken on first-team duties in his absence, confirmed Guidolin is due to return to work this week and said picking up six points from two games would no doubt aid his recovery. \"I know he's delighted and has sent his best wishes,\" said Curtis. \"He'll probably be relaxing now and it's a huge boost for him. \"He's due to leave hospital on Monday. We won't see him for a couple of days, but I expect him to be at the Bournemouth game next Saturday.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Swansea coach Alan Curtis: \"It was a strange game. The first half was poor from both teams but we upped our game and we got the goal. We were hanging on a bit at the end. \"When it's two teams who need the points it affects it. It was one of the worst games of the season. \"We felt like we had to make changes in the second half and everyone played their part and we're delighted. It gives us breathing space.\" Norwich manager Alex Neil: \"It was edgy but I don't think there was a team that was clear. You hope you've got the players to make the difference.

Hamlet's nominations include supporting actor nods for Ciaran Hinds, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, Sian Brooke and Anastasia Hille, while Lyndsey Turner is shortlisted for best director.

      "text": "The Conservative minister said he was inviting other political parties for talks on securing \"the best possible devolution settlement for Wales\". A new UK cabinet committee chaired by Commons Leader William Hague will now meet for the first time on Wednesday. Mr Crabb's comments come as Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones called for a convention on future of the UK. Speaking on Tuesday at the Labour Party conference, Mr Jones said the union cannot be rebuilt through conversation between only Westminster and Scotland. Now the Welsh secretary has pledged to keep Wales at the discussion table on the future of devolved powers across Britain. Mr Crabb said he had already held preliminary discussions with Mr Hague, a former Welsh secretary himself. \"We are both in absolute agreement that Wales should be central to the debate that is now commencing,\" said Mr Crabb. \"I want us to use this opportunity positively to look again at how we secure the best possible devolution settlement for Wales. \"I want to move forward in a realistic, open-minded and pragmatic way.\" Mr Crabb has written to the leaders of other Welsh parties at Westminster inviting them to a Wales Office \"summit\" to discuss \"how we deliver devolution that works for Wales\". The meeting is likely to take place when parliament returns next month. He said he is also arranging meetings with party leaders in the National Assembly to ensure their views feed into the debate. The comments from Mr Crabb came as Prime Minister David Cameron hosted discussions with backbench Tory MPs at his Chequers country residence. One of the two Welsh MPs to attend was the Aberconway MP, Guto Bebb. He said events in Scotland have \"completely changed the nature of the debate\" on devolution. Key to Monday's talks have been the issue of \"English votes for English laws\", which would see Welsh and Scottish MPs excluded from voting on devolved matters in the House of Commons. That has led to Labour Party leader Ed Miliband accusing Mr Cameron of planning to set the UK nations against each other. But the Aberconway MP said he took a different view. \"The promises made to Scotland must be delivered upon and if they are delivered on then we are going to end up in my view with English votes for English laws and that in my view is a simple matter of fairness,\" said Mr Bebb."

Mr Breedlove is in Ukraine for high-level talks with Ukrainian leaders. Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014. Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday that it had deployed a batch of 14 military jets to Crimea, as part of a squadron of 30 that will be stationed on the peninsula. An initial batch of fighter jets were flown to Crimea's Belbek air base \"from military air bases in Krasnodar Territory,\" Russian agency Interfax reported. Gen Breedlove had said earlier on Tuesday that a large number of Russian troops were also active inside Ukraine, training and advising separatist rebels. Russia has continued to deny allegations from western countries that it played any direct role in the conflict in Ukraine, which has claimed more than 4,317 lives. President Vladimir Putin said that Russia \"poses no threat to anyone\" and would \"resist efforts to draw it into geopolitical intrigue,\" Russia's Tass news agency reported on Wednesday. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched a strong attack on Russia's actions against Ukraine whilst addressing a session of parliament in Berlin. \"Nothing justifies or excuses the annexation of Crimea by Russia... Nothing justifies the direct or indirect participation of Russia in the fighting in Donetsk and Luhansk,\" she said, speaking in the Bundestag. \"Russia is calling into question Europe's peaceful order and it is trampling on international law.\" She added that the possibility of a lasting ceasefire in eastern Ukraine was unlikely and therefore continued economic sanctions on Russia remained \"unavoidable\". The US and the EU have placed sanctions on Russia for its alleged involvement in the Ukrainian crisis. Human cost of conflict in east Ukraine 4,317 deaths since April - 957 of them since the 5 September ceasefire, and 9,921 people wounded 466,829 internally displaced people within Ukraine 454,339 refugees living abroad, 387,355 of them in Russia UN data from 18 November Ukraine's year of chaotic events"
